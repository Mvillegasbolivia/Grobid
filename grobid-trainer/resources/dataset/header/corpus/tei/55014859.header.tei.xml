	<div type="abstract">The latest version of the NASA Flying Controls Testbed (FLiC) integrates commercial-<lb/>off-the-shelf components including airframe, autopilot, and a small turbine engine to provide<lb/> a low cost experimental flight controls testbed capable of sustained speeds up to 200 mph.<lb/> The series of flight tests leading up to the demonstrated performance of the vehicle in<lb/> sustained, autopiloted 200 mph flight at NASA Wallops Flight Facility&apos;s UAV runway in<lb/> August 2006 will be described. Earlier versions of the FLiC were based on a modified Army<lb/> target drone, AN/FQM-117B, developed as part of a collaboration between the Aviation<lb/> Applied Technology Directorate at Fort Eustis, Virginia and NASA Langley Research<lb/> Center. The newer turbine powered platform (J-FLiC) builds on the successes using the<lb/> relatively smaller, slower and less expensive unmanned aerial vehicle developed specifically<lb/> to test highly experimental flight control approaches with the implementation of C-coded<lb/> experimental controllers. Tracking video was taken during the test flights at Wallops and<lb/> will be available for presentation at the conference. Analysis of flight data from both<lb/> remotely piloted and autopiloted flights will be presented. Candidate experimental<lb/> controllers for implementation will be discussed. It is anticipated that flight testing will<lb/> resume in Spring 2007 and those results will be included, if possible.<lb/> Nomenclature<lb/> Fps = feet per second<lb/> Mph = miles per hour<lb/> FLiC = Flying Controls Testbed<lb/> J-FLiC = Jet-powered Flying Controls Testbed<lb/> AirSTAR = Airborne Subscale Transport Aircraft Research Testbed<lb/> SOM = Self Organizing Map<lb/> UAV = unmanned aerial vehicle<lb/></div>
