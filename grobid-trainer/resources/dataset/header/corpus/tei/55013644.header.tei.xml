	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Unified speech and audio coding (USAC) is the next step in the evolution of audio codecs that are standardized by<lb/> the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). USAC provides consistent quality for music, speech and mixed<lb/> material, by extending the strength of an audio codec by speech codec functions. Two novel flavors of Spectral<lb/> Band Replication (SBR) were introduced to enhance the perceptual quality of SBR: the Discrete Fourier Transform<lb/> (DFT) based and the Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) bank harmonic SBR. The DFT-based SBR has higher<lb/> frequency resolution for the harmonic transposition process, resulting in good sound quality. The QMF-based SBR<lb/> has significantly lower computational complexity. This paper describes the detailed technical aspects of the low<lb/> complexity QMF-based harmonic SBR tool within USAC. A complexity comparison and the listening test results<lb/> are also presented in the paper.</div>
