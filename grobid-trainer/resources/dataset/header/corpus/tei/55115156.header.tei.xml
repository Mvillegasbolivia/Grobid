	<div type="abstract">Abstract Discrete part manufacturers using robotic arc welding cells often have several more<lb/> geographically distributed plants than welding experts. This ratio often leads to costly downtimes<lb/> due to both logistic and communication deficiencies between weld engineers and the production<lb/> site. The ability for engineers to remotely access welding cells from their home office to<lb/> anywhere in the world can yield several benefits. These include quicker response time to<lb/> problems, improved weld quality, increased production line reliability, and reduced travel time for<lb/> weld engineers. We describe the NIST testbed technology and infrastructure for remote<lb/> manufacturing that has been applied and demonstrated on a robotic welding cell where valuable<lb/> process data can be made available to remotely located engineers in real-time or near real-time.<lb/> Remote access to cell information is made possible by open-architecture interfaces that tie the<lb/> robot controller, weld controller, and cell controller together. The welding cell allows remote<lb/> access through the internet via: an audio/video system for communicating with the operator, a<lb/> pan/tilt/zoom camera inside the welding cell for viewing the cell in operation and inspecting parts<lb/> after a weld, a real-time display for welding process data, a web-based graphic simulation of the<lb/> robot arm driven by real-time motion commands, and an intelligent monitoring system with an<lb/> internet accessible welding database. The cell incorporates multiple weld monitoring systems<lb/> with data logging capability to capture process variables during a weld.<lb/></div>
