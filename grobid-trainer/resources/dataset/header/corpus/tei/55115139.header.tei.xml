	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> The subject of this paper is the extraction of 3D information using an optical image and a SAR image. This aim is made difficult by the<lb/> very different appearances of the landscape and the man-made features in both images. The proposed method is based on the extraction<lb/> of SAR primitives (bright linear and point features). They are then matched to the optical image using the directional and modulus<lb/> gradient map computed on the optical image. A set of matches and associated heights is selected for each primitive. In a first step, the<lb/> digital terrain model is computed in an iterative way around the predominant height of the SAR primitives. In a second step, using the<lb/> external knowledge of a building map, the mean height of each building is computed by means of the previous DTM and the remaining<lb/> matching primitives. The results obtained on an industrial test area are evaluated.<lb/></div>
