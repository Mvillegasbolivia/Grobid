	<div type="abstract">Abstract This paper is a case history which examines the successful application of Intelligent Completion (IC) technology in a cost<lb/> sensitive, mature, onshore North American environment where an existing hydrocarbon miscible flood (HCMF) horizontal<lb/> injection well was retrofitted to manage the injection support of two geologically distinct reservoir regions covering two well<lb/> patterns. The value of IC technology is explored in this early deployment which saw a relatively low cost application<lb/> targeted towards a mature asset. The beneficial results of this application of IC technology were measured in terms of well<lb/> intervention cost savings and affected oil production. This paper presents a relative comparison of those benefits. Though<lb/> this application of IC technology was originally justified by the avoidance of certain future well interventions to modify the<lb/> injection profile, an analysis of the affected pattern production in the post-installation period showed that the benefit to the<lb/> operator was appreciably more from enhanced reservoir management than from the cost savings which were associated with<lb/> workover avoidance.<lb/> Based on the success described in this case history, and reflecting upon the trends of intelligent well and smart field<lb/> technology, the authors explore reasons for its relatively slow uptake in moderate production rate, brownfield applications.<lb/> Large scale reservoir management of miscible flood projects using intelligent well and smart field technologies should<lb/> provide significant value in terms of improved solvent/oil ratio through more efficient monitoring and management of the<lb/> flood. This is probably the most compelling value proposition for IC technology application in moderate production rate land<lb/> applications. This case history is intended to provide credible evidence of the benefit of IC technology in an application with<lb/> cost challenges analogous to those faced by operators who are responsible for cost sensitive, moderate production assets.<lb/> Secondly, it is intended to encourage the IC technology providers to develop more solutions for the brownfield segment of<lb/> the industry, where profitability and value definition can be challenging.<lb/></div>
