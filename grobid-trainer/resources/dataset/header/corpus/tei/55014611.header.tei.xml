	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Rice hull ash (RHA) of large surface area was obtained by acid wash and then calcination at 600°C for 4 h. The white ash was<lb/> then mixed with kaolin and starch to make pellet adsorbents with reasonable strength to be utilized in a packed column. Both ash<lb/> and pellet samples showed good adsorption capacities toward the organic substances in wastewater. Furthermore, the surface nature<lb/> of the white ash and pellet adsorbent could be modi®ed through either hydration or esteri®cation reactions. Corresponding changes<lb/> in silanol concentrations were successfully correlated to changes in adsorption capacity toward either Congo red or vacuum pump<lb/> oil molecules. Ó</div>
