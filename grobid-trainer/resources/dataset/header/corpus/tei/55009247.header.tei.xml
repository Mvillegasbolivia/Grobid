	<div type="abstract">Augmented reality (AR) is a term for a live direct or indirect view of<lb/> a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by<lb/> computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or<lb/> GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated<lb/> reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even<lb/> diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. As a result, the<lb/> technology functions by enhancing one&apos;s current perception of reality.<lb/> By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.<lb/></div>
