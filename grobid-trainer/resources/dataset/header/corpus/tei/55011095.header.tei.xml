	<div type="abstract">A high-pressure (20 MPa) and high-temperature (350 &quot;C) liquid water processing environment was<lb/> used to treat various wastewaters and model compounds. Organics were converted to methane and<lb/> carbon dioxide in the presence of a fixed bed of nickel or ruthenium catalyst. Nitrates were destroyed<lb/> by reaction with methanol in the presence of a nickel catalyst. Noncatalytic hydrolysis of carbon<lb/> tetrachloride and chloroform was also demonstrated. Three scales of continuous-flow reactors were<lb/> used in these tests. Extended tests to demonstrate catalyst lifetimes were also performed. Several<lb/> examples of test results with actual industrial waste streams showed that this process can be effectively<lb/> used with appropriate catalysts to clean wastewater and recover waste organics as useful fuel gas.<lb/></div>
