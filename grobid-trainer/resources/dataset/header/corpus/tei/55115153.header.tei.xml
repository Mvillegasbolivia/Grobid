	<div type="abstract">In thefirst part of this three partpaper; published in January 2002, we dealt with enhancing<lb/> the performance of low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells by improvements<lb/> to the platinum-based cathode materials and to the cathode design. In this second part of<lb/> the paper we shall discuss the improvements in the reformate (CO and COJ tolerance at the<lb/> anode and in extending the MEA durability. Improvements have been achieved by advances<lb/> in platinum/ntthenium electrode design, in the application of bilayer anodes for durable air<lb/> bleed operation, and in the addition oj&apos;a water electrolysis electrocatalyst to the anode for<lb/> cell reversal tolerance. In the third part of the paper the particular challenges presented by<lb/> the direct methanolfuel cell will be discussed.<lb/></div>
