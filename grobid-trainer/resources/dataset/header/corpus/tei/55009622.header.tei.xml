	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Researchers seeking alternatives to traditional desktop computers<lb/> have begun exploring the potential collaborative benefits of<lb/> digital tabletop displays. However, there are still many open<lb/> issues related to the design of collaborative tabletop interfaces,<lb/> such as whether these systems should automatically orient<lb/> workspace items or enforce ownership of workspace content.<lb/> Understanding the natural interaction practices that people use<lb/> during tabletop collaboration with traditional media (e.g., pen and<lb/> paper) can help to address these issues. Interfaces that are<lb/> modeled on these practices will have the additional advantage of<lb/> supporting the interaction skills people have developed over years<lb/> of collaborating at traditional tables. To gain a deeper<lb/> understanding of these interaction practices we conducted two<lb/> observational studies of traditional tabletop collaboration in both<lb/> casual and formal settings. Our results reveal that collaborators<lb/> use three types of tabletop territories to help coordinate their<lb/> interactions within the shared tabletop workspace: personal,<lb/> group, and storage territories. Findings from a spatial analysis of<lb/> collaborators&apos; tabletop interactions reveal important properties of<lb/> these tabletop territories. In order to provide a comprehensive<lb/> picture of the role of tabletop territoriality in collaboration, we<lb/> conclude with a synthesis of our findings and previous research<lb/> findings and with several relevant design implications.<lb/></div>
