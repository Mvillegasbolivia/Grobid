	<div type="abstract">Red wine colour is an integration of contributions from monomeric anthocyanins<lb/> and polymeric pigment forms. Because of gross differences between the two fractions<lb/> in their responses to pH change and to SO2 addition, approximate measures of the<lb/> states of anthocyanin equilibria in young red wines can be routinely made. Recent<lb/> correlations of such measures with independent assessments of relative wine quality<lb/> have prompted further examination and development of the original analytical<lb/> concepts. The equilibria may be described in terms of two percentage parameters a<lb/> and a&apos;, the values of which are related to wine pH and to SO2 added after fermentation.<lb/> Measures of free SO2 and also molecular SOz, anthocyanin content and total phenolics<lb/> are obtained from the same set of spectral data. The interpretations are based upon a<lb/> number of analytical premises for which certain approximations have been necessary.<lb/> These appear to be well justified in comparative evaluations because of the wide range<lb/> of parameter values observed in surveys of current vintage wines. Observations of<lb/> ageing changes in the composition of wine colour, with proposed spectral indices of<lb/> &quot;chemical age&quot;, are also presented.<lb/></div>
