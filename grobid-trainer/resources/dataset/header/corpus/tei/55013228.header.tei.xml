	<div type="abstract">We have investigated the modulation of the optical field transmitted through a colloid of polystyrene spheres<lb/> by a narrow quasi-cw ultrasound beam. Measurements of the scale dependence of the heterodyne modulation<lb/> signal at the acoustic frequency are obtained for samples that are up to 140 scattering lengths thick. A cal-<lb/>culation of the modulation signal predicts the possibility of tomographic imaging, which is confirmed experi-<lb/>mentally.</div>
