	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> To improve embryos&apos; quality and pregnancy rate with the method of<lb/> self-mitochondria transfer.<lb/> All the 18 cases of women with repeated in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer<lb/> (IVF-ET)-treatment failure or older than 37 years were treated with the long gonadotropin<lb/> releasing hormone-agonist (GnRH-a) regimens. The oocytes were divided into two groups:<lb/> intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) group and mitochondria transfer group if the number<lb/> of the individual patients&apos; oocytes was more than four. In mitochondria transfer group,<lb/> mitochondria were prepared by different centrifugation after the granulosa cells were<lb/> trimmed from the oocytes or collected from follicular fluid and homogenated. Mitochondria<lb/> and immobilized sperm were injected into oocytes by micromanipulation. The fertilization rate<lb/> and embryos&apos; quality were compared.<lb/> The fertilization rate was 74.4% in mitochondria transfer group, and 76.8% in ICSI<lb/> group, with no statistical difference (P &gt; 0.05). The good quality embryo rate in mitochondria<lb/> transfer group was 59.4%, and it was 34.9% in ICSI group. The difference was significant (P<lb/> &lt; 0.05). There were 7 clinical pregnancies in the 18 cases.</div>
