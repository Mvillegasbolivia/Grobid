	<div type="abstract">Abstract: The administration of probiotic bacteria is emerging as a potential means of preventing the<lb/> onset or recurrence of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) and of attenuating<lb/> inflammatory activity and preventing relapses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We evaluated the<lb/> efficacy of Bacillus subtilis &apos;PB6&apos; (ATCC – PTA 6737) in a hamster model of antibiotic-induced<lb/> CDAD and in a rat model of IBD. CDAD was induced in male Golden Syrian hamsters using C.<lb/> difficile and clindamycin. These hamsters received either nothing or, by gavage, vancomycin (5 days)<lb/> or PB6 (low, middle and high dose, 6 days). Diarrhea, body weight loss and mortality were observed in<lb/> all groups in which CDAD was induced. Intensity of diarrhea and body weight loss was least in the<lb/> groups treated with vancomycin or with the highest dose of PB6. At the end of the treatment period,<lb/> vancomycin and the highest dose of PB6 were equally efficient in preventing mortality in this hamster<lb/> model of CDAD. No adverse effects of PB6 treatment were observed in healthy animals. In male<lb/> Wistar rats, colitis was induced using a single intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-<lb/>trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Treatments consisted of PB6 (low, middle and high dose),<lb/> Saccharomyces boulardii, mesalazine, infliximab, or no treatment. A possible benefit of the<lb/> prophylactic use of PB6 was also tested. At the end of the treatment period significant differences in<lb/> body weight gain, in colon inflammatory edema and in gross morphology of the colon intestinal lining<lb/> were observed between groups. The groups treated with high dose PB6 could not be distincted from<lb/> the colitis-free negative control group nor from the group treated with mesalazine. The data presented<lb/> are suggestive of possible therapeutic effectiveness of PB6 in CDAD and IBD in humans.<lb/></div>
