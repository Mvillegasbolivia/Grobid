	<div type="abstract">Abstract— Driving an automobile autonomously on rural roads<lb/> requires knowledge about the geometry of the road. Furthermore,<lb/> knowledge about the meaning of each lane of the road is needed<lb/> in order to decide which lane should be taken and if the vehicle<lb/> can do a lane change.<lb/> This paper addresses the problem of extracting additional<lb/> information about lanes. The information is extracted from the<lb/> types of road-markings. The type of lane border markings is<lb/> estimated in order to find out if a lane change is allowed. Arrows,<lb/> which are painted on the road, are extracted and classified in<lb/> order to determine the meaning of a lane such as a turn off lane.<lb/></div>
