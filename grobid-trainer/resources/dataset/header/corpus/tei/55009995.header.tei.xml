	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Server clusters are one of two Microsoft Windows clustering technologies available for the Microsoft Windows<lb/> Server family of products. Windows Server 2003 clusters provide failover support for back-end applications and<lb/> services that require high availability and data integrity. These back-end applications include enterprise<lb/> applications such as database, file server, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and messaging systems. This white<lb/> paper focuses on the architecture and features of the cluster service and describes its terminology, concepts,<lb/> design goals, key components, and planned future directions.</div>
