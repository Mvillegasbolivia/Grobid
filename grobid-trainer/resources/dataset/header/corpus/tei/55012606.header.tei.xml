	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The goal of this project was to explore the potential performance improvements that could be<lb/> gained through the use GPU processing techniques within the CUDA architecture for JPEG<lb/> compression algorithm. The choice of compression algorithms as the focus was based on<lb/> examples of data level parallelism found within the algorithms and a desire to explore the<lb/> effectiveness of cooperative algorithm management between the system CPU and an available<lb/> GPU. In our project we ported JPEG Compression algorithm in CUDA and achieved upto 61%<lb/> performance.<lb/></div>
