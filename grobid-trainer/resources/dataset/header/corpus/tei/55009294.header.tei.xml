	<div type="abstract">Abstract: The applicability of parylene C as an encapsulation<lb/> material for implanted neural prostheses was characterized<lb/> and optimized. The adhesion of parylene C was tested on dif-<lb/>ferent substrate materials, which were commonly used in<lb/> neural prostheses and the efficiency of different adhesion<lb/> promotion methods was investigated. On Si 3 N 4 , platinum,<lb/> and on a first film of parylene C, a satisfactory adhesion was<lb/> achieved with Silane A-174, which even withstood standard<lb/> steam sterilization. The adhesion to gold and polyimide could<lb/> not be improved sufficiently with the tested methods. Fur-<lb/>thermore, tensile tests and measurements of the degree of<lb/> crystallinity were performed on untreated, on steam steri-<lb/>lized, and on annealed parylene C layers to investigate the<lb/> influence of thermal treatment. This led to more brittle and<lb/> stiffer films due to an increase in the crystalline portion in<lb/> the parylene layers. Finally, an electrochemical impedance<lb/> spectroscopy was used to test if a parylene C layer was able<lb/> to protect a metallic structure against corrosion on a Si 3 N 4<lb/> substrate. The results indicated that this could be only possi-<lb/>ble by treating the substrate with Silane A-174. To receive<lb/> parylene C layers with a good encapsulation performance, it<lb/> is important to consider the materials, which are used in the<lb/> neural prosthesis, to find the best suited process parameters.<lb/></div>
