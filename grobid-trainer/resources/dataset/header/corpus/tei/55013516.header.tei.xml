	<div type="abstract">Abstractâ€”Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 4H2 and 6H7, were prepared previously using a protein conjugate of a 1:1 epimeric<lb/> mixture of the synthetic ABC-ring fragments of ciguatoxin (CTX), 3 and 4. Here, the interactions of these mAbs with the fragments<lb/> of CTX and CTX3C, 3 and 5, were investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy in an attempt to clarify an<lb/> antigenic determinant. Compared with the previous synthesis, the fragment 3 possessing the 2S configuration was synthesized from<lb/> tri-O-acetyl-d-glucal much more effectively. The mAb 4H2 was already known to show a dose-dependent binding to the bovine<lb/> serum albumin (BSA) conjugate of 3, but not to that of 5. The present SPR study of 4H2 demonstrates that the A-ring side chain of<lb/> 3 plays a decisive role as an epitope. Therefore, SPR can effectively replace the ELISA method for the analysis of mAbs. #</div>
