	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Asthma is a long-lasting lung disease that causes breathing problems. 50 to 80 % of<lb/> asthma cases may be caused by dust mites and their droppings. This severe reaction is<lb/> initiated by the allergen-specific T cell responsiveness. Effective antigen-specific treatments<lb/> or preventions are still lacking. Using a murine asthma model induced by dust mite extract,<lb/> we first report that co-immunization of DNA and protein vaccines encoding the dust mite<lb/> specific antigen (Der p1) can prevent allergic responses, including the antigen specific IgE<lb/> level and infiltration of lymphocytes and mast cells to the site of the allergen challenge. The<lb/> prevention of Der p1induced asthma is directly related to the induction of a population of<lb/> Der p1 specific iTreg cells exhibiting a CD4+/CD25-/FoxP3+ phenotype. This subtype of<lb/> iTreg cells express IL-10 and TGF-beta, but not CTLA-4 and CCR7 which are well-known<lb/> markers of natural nTreg cells. Adoptive transfer of the iTreg cells is also able to suppress<lb/> the Der p1-induced asthma, suggesting the inhibition potency of the iTreg cells directly on<lb/> the asthma causing T cells. The study demonstrates that utility of the co-immunization<lb/> strategy may present a prophylactive approach clinically and offer us a novel strategy to<lb/> prevent other allergic and asthma diseases in human and animals.</div>
