	<div type="abstract">Preclinical models for the identi®cation of prostate cancer chemoprevention<lb/> agents are lacking. Based upon the notion that clinically useful chemoprevention<lb/> agents should exhibit selective activity against early stage disease, studies were<lb/> undertaken to assess whether chemoprevention agents selectively inhibited the<lb/> growth of early stage prostate cancer, as compared to late stage cancer. First, a<lb/> series of cell and molecular studies were performed, which, when taken together,<lb/> validated the use of a panel of prostate cell lines as a model of the different stages<lb/> of carcinogenesis. Next, therapeutic responsiveness to ten different cytotoxic or<lb/> chemoprevention agents was evaluated. Chemoprevention agents exhibited<lb/> selective activity against normal and early transformed prostate tissue, whereas<lb/> cytotoxic agents were non-speci®c. Selective activity against early versus<lb/> advanced prostate cancer cells is identi®ed as a potential screening method for<lb/> chemoprevention agents.
