	<div type="abstract">Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) catalyses the first step in the<lb/> synthesis of the branched-chain amino acids and is the target of<lb/> several classes of herbicides. Four mutants (A122V, W574S,<lb/> W574L and S653N) of the AHAS gene from Arabidopsis thaliana<lb/> were constructed, expressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzymes<lb/> were purified. Each mutant form and wild-type was characterized<lb/> with respect to its catalytic properties and sensitivity to nine<lb/> herbicides. Each enzyme had a pH optimum near 7.5. The<lb/> specific activity varied from 13 % (A122V) to 131 % (W574L) of<lb/> the wild-type and the K m for pyruvate of the mutants was similar<lb/> to the wild-type, except for W574L where it was five-fold higher.<lb/></div>
