	<div type="abstract">Abstract. The prominence of aviation security has increased<lb/> dramatically in recent years. As a reaction to the new threat situation<lb/> large investments into modern security technology have been made.<lb/> State-of-the-art X-ray screening equipment provides high resolution<lb/> images, many image enhancement features and even automatic<lb/> explosive detection. However, the most expensive equipment is of<lb/> limited value if the humans who operate it are not selected and<lb/> trained to perform their task accurately and efficiently. In fact,<lb/> according to several experts, the human operator is currently the<lb/> weakest link in aviation security. This article presents results of<lb/> studies conducted over the last four years which clearly show that<lb/> threat detection in X-ray images can be increased substantially by<lb/> investing into human factors technologies that are based on results of<lb/> visual cognition, object recognition and psychophysics.<lb/></div>
