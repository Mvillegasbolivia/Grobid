	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Comparison of Methods<lb/> Fig. 3. iCE280 Schematic. Representation of iCE280. Samples are injected into capillary, voltage is<lb/> applied to focus sample, and the progression of sample focusing is monitored by illuminating the<lb/> capillary from underneath and taking an image of the capillary with a CCD camera. The focused<lb/> proteins absorb the 280 nm light and the intensity is measured by the CCD camera.<lb/> Capillary electrophoresis isoelectric focusing has become an increasingly popular choice for<lb/> the analysis of product quality and charge heterogeneity of biological therapeutics. This<lb/> technique offers several advantages over the more commonly used gel and column<lb/> chromatography based methods, the most attractive being ease of development, direct on-line<lb/> quantification using UV detection, automation of high-speed separation, and enhanced<lb/> sensitivity and resolution with decreased analysis time.</div>
