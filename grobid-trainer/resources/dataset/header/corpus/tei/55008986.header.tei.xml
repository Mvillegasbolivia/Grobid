	<div type="abstract">Abstract—The Radio Frequency Identification System<lb/> (RFID) has become a popular system and its applications<lb/> has reached in most of the fields like toll bridge, supply<lb/> chain management and defense sector [8]. The RFID has<lb/> also entered into the field of medical sciences [4, 7].<lb/> Everyday, RFID tags are becoming very small and their<lb/> dimensions are also reducing to 0.002 inches (RFID powder<lb/> tag) developed by Hitachi [10,11]. There are many different<lb/> types of RFID tags available in the market for different<lb/> types of applications. Due to reduction in the cost of<lb/> production, RFID systems are being deployed everywhere in<lb/> large number. Therefore, it becomes important to<lb/> understand the tag technology and their applicability. In<lb/> this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of various<lb/> RFID tag technologies reported in the literatures and<lb/> classify them into different categories.<lb/></div>
