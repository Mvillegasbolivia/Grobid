	<div type="abstract">Abstract:<lb/> This deliverable explores several research lines for the single-user cooperative transmission containing:<lb/> One-way or two-way relays, full or imperfect CSI, multiple relays, full-duplex or half-duplex relays, extended<lb/> Gaussian function, turbo-coded relay transmission, multilayer cooperative DF, management of ARQ and<lb/> design of optimal decoders.<lb/> The different areas under study have been classified in three groups: resource allocation, physical layer<lb/> design and MAC functionalities. It has been shown that an optimal resource allocation can be derived for<lb/> various schemes (precoder optimization with one-way relays, multiple-relay and two-way relay channel).<lb/> Likewise, a network dimensioning tool based on indifference plots will give insights of the benefits of different<lb/> transmission schemes. On the other hand, some aspects like how the turbo-code relay is implemented, new<lb/> transmission schemes or the derivation of optimal decoders are tackled in the physical layer design section.<lb/> This work elucidates two options for adopting the ARQ protocols by the cooperative transmissions: only-<lb/>source manages the procedure or source and relay control the ARQ. An analysis in terms of outage capacity<lb/> is carried out.<lb/></div>
