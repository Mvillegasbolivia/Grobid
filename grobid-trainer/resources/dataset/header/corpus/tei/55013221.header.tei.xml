	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> In this paper, we present FloatingPad, a touchpad-based<lb/> input interface for mobile devices for the navigation and<lb/> the object manipulation in the 3D environment. Many in-<lb/>put interfaces for the 3D environment have been proposed,<lb/> however, most of them were too big to put in mobile de-<lb/>vices. We have focused on a touchpad, a popular input<lb/> interface for laptops, and tried to augment inputs for 3D<lb/> interaction while keeping its form factor. FloatingPad looks<lb/> quite similar to a typical touchpad on a laptop computer, but<lb/> it has higher degree of freedom. Not only can users perform<lb/> only traditional touchpad actions, but they can also slide,<lb/> rotate, and tilt the touchpad by exerting force on it. We<lb/> assigned new actions to yaw, pitch, and roll. Since Float-<lb/>ingPad&apos;s translations of yaw, pitch, roll are greatly intuitive,<lb/> even novice users can naturally navigate the 3D worlds with<lb/> FloatingPad. Hereby we show our FloatingPad concept, its<lb/> hardware design, the software developed for the evaluation,<lb/> results of the evaluation, and our findings from the study.<lb/></div>
