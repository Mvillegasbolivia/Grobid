	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> We propose a blind interference alignment scheme for the vector broadcast channel where<lb/> the transmitter is equipped with M antennas and there are K receivers, each equipped with a<lb/> reconfigurable antenna capable of switching among M preset modes. Without any knowledge of<lb/> the channel coefficient values at the transmitters and with only mild assumptions on the channel<lb/> coherence structure we show that<lb/> M K<lb/> M +K−1 degrees of freedom are achievable. The key to the blind<lb/> interference alignment scheme is the ability of the receivers to switch between reconfigurable<lb/> antenna modes to create short term channel fluctuation patterns that are exploited by the<lb/> transmitter. The achievable scheme does not require cooperation between transmit antennas<lb/> and is therefore applicable to the M × K X network as well. Only finite symbol extensions are<lb/> used, and no channel knowledge at the receivers is required to null the interference.<lb/></div>
