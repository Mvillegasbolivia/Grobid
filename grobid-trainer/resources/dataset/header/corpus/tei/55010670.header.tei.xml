	<div type="abstract">Abstnrct-Palladium-palladium oxide film formed by the RF reactive<lb/> sputtering technique was used for pH measurement. The potentiomet-<lb/>ric mode of operation was employed and an Ag/AgCl electrode was used<lb/> as the reference electrode. The Pd-PdO film was formed on both alu-<lb/>mina and polycrystalline silicon, and sputtering conditions to produce<lb/> Pd-PdO film with good pH response characteristics were empirically<lb/> defined. The Pd-PdO showed good pH response, -54 mV/[pH] at 25Â°C<lb/> over the pH range of 3-9. The temperature dependency and dissolved<lb/> oxygen effect on the film when used as a pH sensor were investigated<lb/> and discussed.<lb/></div>
