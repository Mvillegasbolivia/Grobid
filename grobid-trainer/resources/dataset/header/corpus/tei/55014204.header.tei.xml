	<div type="abstract">Publication costs assisted by Natick Laboratories<lb/> The reactions of some free radicals (RH-) with a number of organic dyes (D) have been examined in<lb/> aqueous solutions, using the. fast-reaction technique of pulse radiolysis. The radicals studied include<lb/> CHzOH, (CH&amp;COH, NHzCHCOO-, G O H (C = cytosine), .TH (TH2 = dihydrothymine), and C H 2 -<lb/>and were produced by reaction of the substrates with OH radicals. The dyes used were Crystal Violet,<lb/> Safranine T , Phenosafranine, Indigo Di-and Tetrasulfonate, Methylene Blue, Thionine, Indophenol and<lb/> 2,6-Dichloroindophenol. The electron transfer reaction, RH. + D -R + .D-+ H + (kl), were deter-<lb/>mined by following the bleaching kinetics of the dyes a t the wavelengths where they absorb. The rates<lb/> were found to increase monotonically with increase in the redox potential E , of the dyes examined. Sim-<lb/>ilarly the efficiencies (expressed in percentage) of these reactions were obtained and found to be marked-<lb/>ly dependent upon the E , values of the dyes in the range from -0.357 to +0.217 V. These results are<lb/> discussed and the suggestion made that this correlation represents the dependence upon AEm. the differ-<lb/>ence in the redox potentials of the donor radical and the acceptor dyes.<lb/></div>
