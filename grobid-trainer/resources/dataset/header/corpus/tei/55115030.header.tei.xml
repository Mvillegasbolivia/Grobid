	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The goal of this white paper is to describe representative usage scenarios and their<lb/> corresponding requirements, as well as state-of-the-art technological solutions and open<lb/> research directions for key functionalities related to content-centric architectures for<lb/> networks of moving objects. The usage scenarios presented include smart transport, data<lb/> dissemination in partially connected environments, collaborative sensing, and situation and<lb/> presence-aware services. The functionalities discussed include name resolution, routing,<lb/> forwarding, discovery, content sharing, in-network caching, and the generalization of<lb/> content-centric networking to service-centric networking.<lb/></div>
