	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/>The aim of the present study was to characterize the endothelium-dependent relaxation elicited by ginsenosides, amixture of saponin<lb/> extracted from Panaxginseng, in isolated rataorta. Relaxations elicited by ginsenosides were mimicked by ginsenoside Rg and<lb/> 3<lb/> ginsenoside Rg, two major ginsenosides of the protopanaxatriol group. Ginsenoside Rg was about 100-fold more potent than<lb/> 13<lb/> ginsenoside Rg. The endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to ginsenoside Rg was associated with the formation of cyclc GMP.<lb/> 13<lb/> These effects were abolished by N<lb/>G<lb/>-nitro-L-arginine and methylene blue. Relaxations in response to ginsenoside Rg were unaffected by<lb/> 3<lb/>w<lb/>2<lb/>7,9x<lb/>atropine,diphenhydramine,D-Pro,D-TrpsubstanceP,propranolol,nifedipine,verapamil and glibenclamidebut were markedly<lb/> reduced by tetraethylammonium. Tetraethylammonium modestly reduced the relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside. These findings<lb/> indicate that ginsenoside Rg is a major mediator of the endothelium-dependent nitricoxide-mediated relaxation in response to<lb/> 3<lb/>ginsenosides in isolated rataorta, possibly via activation of tetraethylammonium-sensitive K<lb/>q channels.</div>
