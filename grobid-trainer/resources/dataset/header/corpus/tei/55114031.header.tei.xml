	<titlePart>UCECOAT Â® Waterborne UV Resins<lb/> for Field Applied Wood Floor Finishes<lb/></titlePart>
	</docTitle>

	<div type="abstract">UCECOAT waterborne UV resins are recommended for use in field applied wood topcoats. The low<lb/> viscosity of UCECOAT resins, obtained without the use of low molecular weight acrylate diluents,<lb/> provides ease of application in the field with minimal coating penetration into the substrate.<lb/> UCECOAT resins that are tack-free before cure are typically used to avoid dust pick-up and/or<lb/> damage to uncured coatings.<lb/> The choice of UCECOAT waterborne UV resin is based on the desired final coating properties.<lb/> Toughness, flexibility, chemical resistance, hardness, abrasion resistance, cure speed, and adhesion<lb/> are some of those properties that can be provided. Tables 1 and 2 provide information on the<lb/> UCECOAT resins that are recommended for use in field applied wood floor finishes. General<lb/> starting point formulations for field applied gloss and matte wood topcoats are given in Tables 3 and<lb/> 4. The performance properties of the gloss and matte coatings are shown in Table 5. The gloss<lb/> finish was prepared by applying two coats of waterbased sealer to oak, followed by one coat of UV<lb/> curable topcoat. All coatings were lightly sanded before recoating. The matte finishes were prepared<lb/> as follows:<lb/> 1. Sand the wood panel with P240 sandpaper.<lb/> 2. Apply first coat at 90 microns (3.6 mils) wet, and air dry to &lt; 6% moisture content.<lb/> 3. Apply second coat at 55 microns (2.2 mils) wet, air dry to &lt; 6% moisture content, and cure at<lb/> 25 fpm (400-500 mJ/cm<lb/> </div>
