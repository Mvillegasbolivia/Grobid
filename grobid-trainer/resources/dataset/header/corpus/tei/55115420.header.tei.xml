	<div type="abstract">In computing, extract, transform, and load (ETL) refers to a process in database usage and<lb/> especially in data warehousing that:<lb/> Extracts data from outside sources<lb/> ■ Transforms it to fit operational needs, which can include quality levels<lb/> ■ Loads it into the end target (database, more specifically, operational data store, data mart, or<lb/> data warehouse)<lb/> ■<lb/> ETL systems are commonly used to integrate data from multiple applications, typically developed<lb/> and supported by different vendors or hosted on separate computer hardware. The disparate systems<lb/> containing the original data are frequently managed and operated by different employees. For<lb/> example a cost accounting system may combine data from payroll, sales and purchasing.<lb/></div>
