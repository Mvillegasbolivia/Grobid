	<div type="abstract">Abstract This paper describes a case study of the application of smart<lb/> field technologies to the SACROC Unit Carbon dioxide<lb/> Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO 2 -EOR) project in Scurry County,<lb/> Texas. A five-well pilot project was implemented in early<lb/> 2005 to demonstrate the ability of intelligent well down-hole<lb/> flow control valves to restrict or isolate the production of CO 2<lb/> from breakthrough zones in production wells and to control<lb/> the distribution of CO 2 injection in injection wells. The<lb/> objective is to reduce unnecessary cycling of CO 2 between<lb/> injectors and producers, improve sweep efficiency, increase<lb/> oil production and improve ultimate oil reserve recovery. This<lb/> is done with cost effective, fit-for-purpose intelligent well<lb/> systems.<lb/> The intelligent well technologies and work processes<lb/> described in this paper are applicable to all EOR/IOR field<lb/> development plans, and in particular to CO 2 WAG<lb/> developments. The intelligent well technologies as used in this<lb/> example are applicable to layered, compartmentalized and<lb/> complex reservoirs, in particular for patterned secondary and<lb/> tertiary flood processes.<lb/> Initial results show the CO2 production can be<lb/> significantly reduced while maintaining economic oil<lb/> production. The intelligent well equipment also allows<lb/> selective testing and stimulation of zones within a well<lb/> without slick line and electric line (e-line) intervention.<lb/></div>
