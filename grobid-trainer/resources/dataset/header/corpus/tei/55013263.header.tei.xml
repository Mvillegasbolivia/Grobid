	<div type="abstract">Abstract: -This paper discusses wavelet-based algorithm for audio denoising. We focused on audio<lb/> signals corrupted with white noise which is especially hard to remove because it is located in all<lb/> frequencies. We use Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) to transform noisy audio signal in wavelet<lb/> domain. It is assumed that high amplitude DWT coefficients represent signal, and low amplitude<lb/> coefficients represent noise. Using thresholding of coefficients and transforming them back to time<lb/> domain it is possible to get audio signal with less noise. We are proposing modified universal<lb/> thresholding of coefficients which results with better audio signal. The main criterion for evaluation of<lb/> experimental results was objective degree grade (ODG).<lb/>
