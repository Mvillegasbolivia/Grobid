	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Software maintenance and evolution is arguably a lengthy and ex-<lb/>pensive phase in the life cycle of a software system. A critical issue<lb/> at this phase is change propagation: given a set of primary changes<lb/> that have been made to software, what additional secondary changes<lb/> are needed? Although many approaches have been proposed, auto-<lb/>mated change propagation is still a significant technical challenge<lb/> in software maintenance and evolution. This paper presents a Ph.D.<lb/> research in the final stages of developing and evaluating a novel,<lb/> agent-based, framework to support semi-automated change propa-<lb/>gation in evolving software systems.<lb/></div>
