	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Web sites are routinely visited by automated agents<lb/> known as Web robots, that perform acts ranging from the<lb/> beneficial, such as indexing for search engines, to the ma-<lb/>licious, such as searching for vulnerabilities, attempting<lb/> to crack passwords, or spamming bulletin boards. Previ-<lb/>ous work to identify malicious robots has relied on ad-hoc<lb/> signature matching and has been performed on a per-site<lb/> basis. As Web robots evolve and diversify, these tech-<lb/>niques have not been scaling.<lb/> We approach the problem as a special form of the Tur-<lb/>ing test and defend the system by inferring if the traf-<lb/>fic source is human or robot. By extracting the implicit<lb/> patterns of human Web browsing, we develop simple<lb/> yet effective algorithms to detect human users. Our ex-<lb/>periments with the CoDeeN content distribution network<lb/> show that 95% of human users are detected within the first<lb/> 57 requests, and 80% can be identified in only 20 requests,<lb/> with a maximum false positive rate of 2.4%. In the time<lb/> that this system has been deployed on CoDeeN, robot-<lb/>related abuse complaints have dropped by a factor of 10.<lb/></div>
