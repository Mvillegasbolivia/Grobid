	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The interest in the application of a SCR connected to a FPSO for exploration and production in deep water, has motivated the<lb/> need to carefully study this concept due to the high offsets and vertical motions imposed by the vessel at the top of the riser.<lb/> Petrobras has developed through its Research Center the study of different steel riser configurations. For bow turret-moored<lb/> and spread-moored FPSOs based on VLCC converted hulls, the steel lazy-wave riser (SLWR) has been considered as an<lb/> adequate solution due to its structural dynamic behavior and costs when compared to other configurations.<lb/> Although the SLWR furnishes acceptable results for fatigue and extreme environmental conditions, the search for the best<lb/> configuration is very demanding as any changes to a geometric parameter affect its whole structural dynamic behaviour. The<lb/> search for configurations that meet all the code criteria for the riser project required meticulous detail that has not always lead<lb/> to the best results because the number of variables involved is quite significant. Another important aspect is the installation<lb/> procedure that can also influence the final configuration.<lb/> In order to reduce the engineering time in generating and analyzing several configurations, optimization tools were studied and<lb/> used in association with Petrobras in-house software to help define a model that could achieve all design verification phases<lb/> more easily.<lb/> This paper presents the experience with the use of an optimization procedure applied to facilitate the design of a SLWR<lb/> connected to a FPSO unit offshore Brazil.<lb/> The process of optimization begins with a set of preliminary geometric variables and constraints that are associated with<lb/> multiple objectives related to economic, construction and safety factors. The result of the optimization process is a set of<lb/> feasible configurations from which, through careful selection, the &quot;one of the best&quot; configuration is chosen.<lb/></div>
