	<div type="abstract">IN THIS chapter, the principles of radio frequency ( RF ) fi ngerprinting<lb/> methods, also known as database correlation methods ( DCM s), are presented.<lb/> Although there is a wide variety of DCM implementations, they all share the<lb/> same basic elements. These elements are identifi ed and analyzed in this chapter.<lb/> Different alternatives for building RF fi ngerprint correlation database s ( CDB s) are<lb/> presented, and the advantages and drawbacks of each of them are discussed, as<lb/> well as their impact on the positioning accuracy of location services based on<lb/> DCM. Different methods to numerically evaluate the similarity between each<lb/> fi ngerprint within the CDB and the measured RF fi ngerprint are presented,<lb/> including an artifi cial neural network (ANN) -based approach. Two alternatives to<lb/> reduce the correlation or search space are analyzed, including an approach based<lb/> on genetic algorithms (GAs). Finally, fi eld tests are used to evaluate the<lb/> positioning accuracy of fi ngerprinting techniques in both Global System for<lb/> Mobile Communications ( GSM ) and Wi -Fi ( wireless fi delity ) 802.11b networks.<lb/></div>
