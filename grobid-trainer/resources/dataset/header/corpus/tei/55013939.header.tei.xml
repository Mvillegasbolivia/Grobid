	<div type="abstract">The competition between superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) for 0; radicals<lb/> in the presence of a number of physiologically active compounds was studied. The Na+ channel blockers,<lb/> ajmaline, tetracaine, bipuvacaine, lidocaine and etmozine produced an increase in the amount of 0, react-<lb/>ing with SOD. Nitroprusside, ferricyanide, BAY K8644, levomycetin, cGMP, CAMP and GMP acted in<lb/> the opposite way. All the SOD activtors had in common the property of being electron donors in the reac-<lb/>tions with the light-induced free radicals of eosin whereas the SOD inhibitors behaved as electron acceptors.<lb/> The electron activity of SOD modulators correlated qualitatively with their regulating efficacy.<lb/></div>
