	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) provides holographic sound reproduction for a large listening area. Fundamentals of<lb/> WFS recording and reproduction techniques have been developed in the past few years, however there is a lack of<lb/> intuitive tools for WFS mixing and mastering. In this paper the authors propose a WFS user interface compatible<lb/> with available and accepted digital audio workstations. These WFS-plug-ins are based on a novel audio network<lb/> technology. They open new possibilities for creative audio production in WFS.<lb/></div>
