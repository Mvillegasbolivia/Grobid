It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-born American physics professor.<lb/> The Elo system was invented as an improved chess rating system, but today it is also used in many other games. It is<lb/> also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of computer games,<lb/> [1] and has been adapted to<lb/> team sports including association football, American college football and basketball, and Major League Baseball.<lb/></div>
