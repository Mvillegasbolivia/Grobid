	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Insect and mite pests cause serious damage to the hazelnut crop worldwide. The<lb/> control strategies used against these pests include application of insecticides, clas-<lb/>sical and augmentative biological control, utilization of resistant varieties, and<lb/> use of Bacillus thuringiensis–based preparations. In the United States, exten-<lb/>sive research has been directed toward elucidating ecological interactions among<lb/> different pests and natural enemies and understanding the role of abiotic factors<lb/> in pest population dynamics. Differences exist worldwide regarding the under-<lb/>standing of pests and natural enemy biologies and, to a limited extent, control<lb/> practices. An integrated pest management approach based on utilizing effective<lb/> sampling and monitoring techniques and a near complete reliance on biological<lb/> control and &quot;soft&quot; pesticides, including insect growth regulators, is currently un-<lb/>der development both in North America and Europe/Turkey. Hazelnuts are on<lb/> the verge of becoming one of the first crops in the United States that could pos-<lb/>sibly be produced commercially without the use of any broad-spectrum organic<lb/> insecticides.<lb/></div>
