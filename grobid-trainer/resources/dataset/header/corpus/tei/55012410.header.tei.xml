	<div type="abstract">process migration,<lb/> distributed systems,<lb/> distributed operating<lb/> systems,<lb/> load distribution<lb/> Process migration is the act of transferring a process<lb/> between two machines. It enables dynamic load distribution,<lb/> fault resilience, eased system administration, and data<lb/> access locality. Despite these goals and ongoing research<lb/> efforts, migration has not achieved widespread use. With the<lb/> increasing deployment of distributed systems in general, and<lb/> distributed operating systems in particular, process<lb/> migration is again receiving more attention in both research<lb/> and product development. As high performance facilities<lb/> shift from supercomputers to networks of workstations, and<lb/> with the ever-increasing role of the World Wide Web, we<lb/> expect migration to play a more important role and<lb/> eventually to be widely adopted.<lb/> This survey reviews the field of process migration by<lb/> summarizing the key concepts and giving an overview of the<lb/> most important<lb/> implementations.<lb/> Design and<lb/> implementation issues of process migration are analyzed in<lb/> general, and then revisited for each of the case studies<lb/> described: MOSIX, Sprite, Mach and Load Sharing Facility.<lb/> The benefits and drawbacks of process migration depend on<lb/> the details of implementation and therefore this paper<lb/> focuses on practical matters. This survey will help in<lb/> understanding the potentials of process migration and why<lb/> it has not caught on.<lb/></div>
