	<div type="abstract">Abstract Through our newly-developed &quot;chemical vapor deposition integrated process (CVD-IP)&quot; using carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as the raw material<lb/> and only carbon source introduced, CO 2 could be catalytically activated and converted to a new solid-form product, i.e., carbon nanotubes<lb/> (CO 2 -derived) at a quite high yield (the single-pass carbon yield in the solid-form carbon-product produced from CO 2 catalytic capture and<lb/> conversion was more than 30% at a single-pass carbon-base). For comparison, when only pure carbon dioxide was introduced using the<lb/> conventional CVD method without integrated process, no solid-form carbon-material product could be formed. In the addition of saturated<lb/> steam at room temperature in the feed for CVD, there were much more end-opening carbon nano-tubes produced, at a slightly higher carbon<lb/> yield. These inspiring works opened a remarkable and alternative new approach for carbon dioxide catalytic capture to solid-form product,<lb/> comparing with that of CO 2 sequestration (CCS) or CO 2 mineralization (solidification), etc. As a result, there was much less body volume and<lb/> almost no greenhouse effect for this solid-form carbon-material than those of primitive carbon dioxide.<lb/></div>
