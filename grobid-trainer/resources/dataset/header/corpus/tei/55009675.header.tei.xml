	<div type="abstract">Every new movie excites with attractive visual effects. Only few people know that the most thrilling<lb/> cuts are realized by using virtual persons. The faces and bodies of actors are digitized and the<lb/> &quot;virtual twin&quot; replaces the actor in the movie. The state of the human body digitization is so high<lb/> that it is not possible any more to distinguish the real actor from the virtual one. Indeed, for the rush<lb/> technical development has to be thanked the movie industry, which was one of the strong<lb/> economic motors for this technology. Today&apos;s, methods for digitization of the human body are used<lb/> also in other fields of application, such as ergonomics, medical applications, computer games,<lb/> biometry and anthropometrics. With the time, this technology becomes interesting also for sport,<lb/> fitness, fashion and beauty. A large expansion of human body digitization is expected in the near<lb/> future.<lb/> We will report here on the historic development of the human body digitization and on the actual<lb/> state of the technology. We will then describe the possible commercial uses and new interesting<lb/> perspectives.<lb/></div>
