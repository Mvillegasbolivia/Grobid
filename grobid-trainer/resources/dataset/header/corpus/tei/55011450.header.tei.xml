	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> For automated image evaluation a precise characterization of the noise behaviour of the image data is needed. Digital image<lb/> acquisition in aerial photogrammetry usually is performed by digitizing analogue material. The noise of the digital image<lb/> is composed of the noise due to the digitization process and of the noise of the analogue image. From a statistical point of<lb/> view, noise can be described by the standard deviation and the correlation of the of the intensity values. Our aim<lb/> is to determine a noise model out of the images itself, without the need of special test patterns. We do this by following<lb/> two approaches: pixelwise evaluation of multiple scans of the material and regionwise evaluation from a single scan. The<lb/> approach analyses the noise coming from the digitization process, while in the second case we obtain the complete noise<lb/> budget. We analyze the correlation between successive scans. First empirical investigations with diierent material were<lb/> performed and the results are presented.<lb/></div>
