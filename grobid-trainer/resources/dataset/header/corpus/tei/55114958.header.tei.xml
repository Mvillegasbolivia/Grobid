	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> OBJECTIVE: Although there have been several studies that compared the efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and cor-<lb/>onary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the impact of off-pump CABG (OPCAB) has not been well elucidated. The objective of the present<lb/> study was to compare the outcomes after PCI, on-pump CABG (ONCAB), and OPCAB in patients with multivessel and/or left main<lb/> disease.<lb/> METHODS: Among the 9877 patients undergoing first PCI using bare-metal stents or CABG who were enrolled in the CREDO-Kyoto<lb/> Registry, 6327 patients with multivessel and/or left main disease were enrolled into the present study (67.9 ± 9.8 years old). Among<lb/> them, 3877 patients received PCI, 1388 ONCAB, and 1069 OPCAB. Median follow-up was 3.5 years.<lb/> RESULTS: Comparing PCI with all CABG (ONCAB and OPCAB), propensity-score-adjusted all-cause mortality after PCI was higher than<lb/> that CABG (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.37 (1.15–1.63), p &lt; 0.01). The incidence of stroke was lower after PCI than that<lb/> after CABG (0.75 (0.59–0.96), p = 0.02). CABG was associated with better survival outcomes than PCI in the elderly (interaction<lb/> p = 0.04). Comparing OPCAB with PCI or ONCAB, propensity-score-adjusted all-cause mortality after PCI was higher than that after<lb/> OPCAB (1.50 (1.20–1.86), p &lt; 0.01). Adjusted mortality was similar between ONCAB and OPCAB (1.18 (0.93–1.51), p = 0.33). The inci-<lb/>dence of stroke after OPCAB was similar to that after PCI (0.98 (0.71–1.34), p &gt; 0.99), but incidence of stroke after ONCAB was higher<lb/> than that after OPCAB (1.59 (1.16–2.18), p &lt; 0.01).<lb/> CONCLUSIONS: In patients with multivessel and/or left main disease, CABG, particularly OPCAB, is associated with better survival out-<lb/>comes than PCI using bare-metal stents. Survival outcomes are similar between ONCAB and OPCAB.<lb/></div>
