	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> This paper discusses an approach employing a Pluronic 123 (P123) surfactant that<lb/> acts as a reductant of silver at critical concentrations, while also investigating both<lb/> a hydrothermal treatment at autogenous pressure in autoclave and one atmosphere<lb/> reflux at approximately 100 Â°C. As the key issue of reproducibility becomes the<lb/> cornerstone of research, the effects of changes in different variables such as the<lb/> ratio between P123 and silver nitrate, the concentration of reactants, the<lb/> temperature at which the reaction takes place, and the type of solvent employed<lb/> were examined. Though an SEM was unavailable to analyze the morphology of<lb/> the nanomaterial, X-ray diffraction confirmed that silver (01-089-3722) was<lb/> produced with crystal sizes up to 60 nanometers. Additionally, experiments were<lb/> run concerning the optimal concentration of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) when<lb/> using ethylene glycol to reduce silver. After using concentrations of 0.02 M, 0.2<lb/> M, and 2.0 M PVP, it was discovered that the most favorable concentration was<lb/> slightly less than 0.2 M using intensities of peaks from X-ray diffraction. Though<lb/> problems with replication have not been resolved, the use of reflux techniques at<lb/> lower temperatures resulted in promising results. Still, further testing must be<lb/> carried out in order to pinpoint the reaction conditions between P123 and silver<lb/> nitrate and to design a technique that is easily reproduced.<lb/></div>
