	<div type="abstract">Summary<lb/> A twenty year old stay cable was dismantled because it showed many ruptures at<lb/> one of its terminations. The examination of the wire breakages showed evidence of<lb/> fatigue. Analysis of the dynamic behaviour of the stay cable was carried out. It<lb/> showed that the combination of flexural bending stresses with fretting stresses<lb/> between the outside layer and wire serving lead to a stress range beyond the<lb/> endurance threshold. Recorded measurements of transversal vibration<lb/> displacements near the sockets show that high modes of wind induced vibrations<lb/> (Karman Vortex) were involved in the fatigue occurrence. Examination of the internal<lb/> state of three other cables confirms the analysis of displacement records in relation<lb/> with the fatigue limit.<lb/></div>
