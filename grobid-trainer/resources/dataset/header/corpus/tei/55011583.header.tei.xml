	<div type="abstract">Abstract In order to have a fast recalibration method of magnetic flux leakage (MFL) inspection systems it is<lb/> proposed to use a drilled hole as the reference. The hole can be drilled in the pipe end region which will<lb/> be cut in further production. The fast recalibration is important if quantitative testing including defect<lb/> separation is required but small lot sizes would normally lead to very frequent calibration cycles. In this<lb/> work we present a calculation of MFL signals of standard notches and drill-holes with the goal of finding<lb/> a corresponding calibration scheme. The work is based on finite element modelling (FEM). As result we<lb/> show that it is indeed possible to assign equivalent drill-holes to a specified notch-depth, however, only<lb/> for a certain range of parameters. This range depends mainly on the sensor lift-off.<lb/></div>
