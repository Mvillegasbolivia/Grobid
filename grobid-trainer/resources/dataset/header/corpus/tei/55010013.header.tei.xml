	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Soft tissue reconstruction using tissue-engineered constructs requires the development of<lb/> materials that are biocompatible and support cell adhesion and growth. The objective of this<lb/> study was to evaluate the use of macroporous hydrogel fragments that were formed using<lb/> either unmodified alginate or alginate covalently linked with the fibronectin cell adhesion<lb/> peptide RGD (alginate-RGD). These materials were injected into the subcutaneous space of<lb/> adult, domesticated female sheep and harvested for histological comparisons at 1 and 3<lb/> months. In addition, the alginate-RGD porous fragments were seeded with autologous sheep<lb/> preadipocytes isolated from the omentum, and these cell-based constructs were also im-<lb/>planted. The results from this study indicate that both the alginate and alginate-RGD sub-<lb/>cutaneous implants supported tissue and vascular ingrowth. Furthermore, at all time points<lb/> of the experiment, a minimal inflammatory response and capsule formation surrounding the<lb/> implant were observed. The implanted materials also maintained their sizes over the 3-month<lb/> study period. In addition, the alginate-RGD fragments supported the adhesion and prolif-<lb/>eration of sheep preadipocytes, and adipose tissue was present within the transplant site of<lb/> these cellular constructs, which was not present within the biomaterial control sites.<lb/></div>
