	<div type="abstract">This article describes the Microsoft vision for a replacement for VGA, the current standard for the minimum graphics<lb/> support required by all PCs. Some of the original requirements of VGA are becoming harder to support as the PC<lb/> continues to evolve. The VGA standard from the 1980s makes demands on hardware and software that are outdated<lb/> today, such as the use of Int 10 services, a non-linear frame buffer, a very limited range of display modes, and direct<lb/> register addressing using real-mode assembly language.<lb/> Universal Graphics Adapter (UGA) is a hardware-independent design that encapsulates and abstracts any low-level<lb/> graphics hardware in a standard way by the use of firmware. It will not require the use of real-mode assembly<lb/> language, direct hardware register or frame buffer access to program. It will provide support for basic drawing<lb/> operations, continuous display modes and, eventually, power management. As a firmware-based standard, it will<lb/> allow future evolution to support new hardware features as they become available.<lb/></div>
