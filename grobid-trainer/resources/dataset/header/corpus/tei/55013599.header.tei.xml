	<div type="abstract">X<lb/> Four analogs and two homologs of cocaine, designed as potent cocaine antagonists, were<lb/> synthesized. The S N 2 reaction between ecgonine methyl ester (13) or appropriately substituted<lb/> piperidinol (19, 21) and appropriately substituted 4-iodobenzoyl chloride gave 4-iodobenzoyl<lb/> esters of tropanes and piperidines (5-8). 2′-Hydroxycocaine (9) was obtained from 2′-<lb/>acetoxycocaine (12) by selective transesterification with MeOH saturated with dry HCl gas.<lb/> 2′-Acetoxycocaine (12) was synthesized from acetylsalicyloyl chloride (23) and ecgonine methyl<lb/> ester (13). The binding affinities of these compounds were determined at the dopamine<lb/> transporter for the displacement of [ 3 H]WIN-35428. An iodo group substitution at the 4′-position<lb/> of cocaine decreased dopamine transporter binding potency, while a hydroxy or acetoxy group<lb/> at the 2′-position exhibited increased binding potency for the dopamine transporter compared<lb/> to cocaine (10-and 3.58-fold, respectively). 2′-Hydroxylation also enhanced the binding potency<lb/> of 4′-iodococaine (5) by 10-fold. Replacement of the tropane ring with piperidine led to poor<lb/> binding affinities.<lb/></div>
