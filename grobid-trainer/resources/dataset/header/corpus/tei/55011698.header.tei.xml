	<div type="abstract">A microtiter technique was investigated as a means of evaluating viable cells in<lb/> bacterial cultures. Parallel experiments were performed employing the conventional<lb/> agar plate method along with the microtiter procedure. Statistical analyses showed<lb/> that the correlation between the two methods was highly significant. With this new<lb/> method, many samples were analyzed simultaneously, and readable results were<lb/> obtained in 12 to 15 hr. Other advantages of this method were substantial savings of<lb/> time, space, and materials. Also, the applicability of this method to estimates of<lb/> mixed bacterial populations was demonstrated by studying the associative growth of<lb/> two bacterial cultures.<lb/> </div>

	<div type="introduction">The agar plate method has been used by investi-<lb/>gators in many areas of microbiology for evalua-<lb/>ting densities of viable bacteria. The procedures,<lb/> merits, defects, and references for the method are<lb/> recorded in great detail in Standard Methods for<lb/> the Examination of Dairy Products (1). Less<lb/> cumbersome methods, including loop dilution<lb/> techniques, have been suggested from time to<lb/> time (2). A microtiter method based on the loop<lb/> dilution principle was developed in this laboratory</div>
