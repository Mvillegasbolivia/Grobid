	<div type="abstract">Natural rubber latex (NRL) concentrates are important raw materials which are being used for the<lb/> manufacture of products such as gloves, condoms, foams, balloons, catheters, baby soothers, dental<lb/> dams, latex thread or elastic. Creaming is one of the methods for obtaining latex concentrate from field<lb/> latex. This paper compares a synthetic creaming agent (sodium alginate) with an agricultural one<lb/> (Tamarind seed powder), in the production of latex concentrates from field latex. From the results, the<lb/> value of dry rubber contents (DRCs), which is the major parameter for evaluating extent of latex<lb/> concentration, was slightly higher for concentrate obtained by Tamarind seed powder (60.10%) than<lb/> that by sodium alginate (59.10%). This could be attributed to greater water-absorbing capacity of the<lb/> former than the latter. Overall, the property of latex concentrates obtained from both creaming agents<lb/> compared favourably with literature.<lb/></div>
