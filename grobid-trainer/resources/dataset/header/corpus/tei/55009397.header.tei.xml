	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> A novel layered calcosilicate (CAS-1) was employed to immobilize an iron-based diimine catalyst 2,6-bis[1-(2,6-<lb/>diisopropylphenylimino)ethyl]pyridine iron chloride (I) onto it to form a supported catalyst (CC) for the first time.<lb/> The crystal structure of CAS-1 was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis in addition to SEM characterization.<lb/> The CC-catalyzed ethylene polymerization exhibited good catalytic activities with either co-catalyst methylaluminoxane<lb/> (MAO) or triethylaluminum (TEA). The resulting polyethylenes possessed not only higher molecular weight, melting<lb/> temperature (T m ), and decomposition onset temperature (T onset ) than those obtained with its homogeneous counter-<lb/>part, but also a unique morphology.<lb/></div>
