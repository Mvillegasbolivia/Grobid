	<div type="abstract">Abstractâ€”The IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN current standardiza-<lb/>tion struggles to comprehend with emerging bandwidth-thirsty<lb/> applications and services. For that reason, a pristine Task Group<lb/> was initiated, known as TGn, in order to form a new amendment<lb/> that will offer higher efficiency and throughputs of more than<lb/> 100 Mbps, as measured at the MAC data service access point. To<lb/> achieve this goal, key PHY and MAC enhancements have been<lb/> proposed within the latest standard draft. This paper investigates<lb/> the throughput limits that existing techniques comprise, mainly<lb/> because of PHY/MAC overhead and it describes TGn&apos;s proposed<lb/> frame aggregation enhancements. Our simulation results con-<lb/>firms that the A-MSDU, A-MPDU and a combination of these<lb/> two can improve extensively the channel efficiency and the data<lb/> throughput and finally concludes with a comparison analysis<lb/> between these innovative frame aggregation mechanisms.<lb/></div>
