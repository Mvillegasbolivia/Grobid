	<div type="abstract">Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to clarify the reference vibrotactile perception thresholds<lb/> (VPT) for healthy people in Malaysia. The measurement equipment standard, ISO 13091-1, of the<lb/> vibrotactile perception thresholds for the assessment of nerve dysfunction and the analysis and<lb/> interpretation of measurements at the fingertips standard, ISO 13091-2, were published in ISO/TC108/<lb/> SC4/WG8 on 2001 and 2003 individually. In the ISO 13091-2 standard, the reference VPT data were<lb/> obtained from few research papers. Malaysian people&apos;s VPT data don&apos;t include to this standard. In<lb/> Malaysia, when the VPT is using to diagnose of the hand-arm vibration syndrome, the reference VPT<lb/> data need to compare with the worker&apos;s ones. But, Malaysia does not have the reference VPT data yet.<lb/> So, in this paper, the VPT was measured by using ISO 13091-1 standard equipment to obtain the<lb/> reference data for Malaysian people. And these data were compared with the ISO reference data on<lb/> the ISO 13091-2 standard. From the comparison of these data, it was clear that the Malaysian healthy<lb/> people&apos;s VPT data were consistent with the reference data of the ISO 13091-2 standard.<lb/></div>
