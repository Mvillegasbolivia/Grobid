	<div type="abstract">Results: Among 644 non DM patients enrolled to the study 350 (54.35%) were<lb/> male. Mean age was 41.34 ± 13.8 year (range 12-82). PTDM developed in 66<lb/> patients (10.2%). among PTDM patients 36 were female and 40 were male (P =<lb/> 0.172). Patients divided in three groups according to age: age&lt; 40 year, 40&lt;60<lb/> and age &gt; 60. Prevalence of PTDM were 3.8%, 15.6% and 20.3% among<lb/> different age groups respectively (P&lt; 0001). PTDM developed in 8.3% of<lb/> patients with and in 10.3% without past history of CMV infection (P = 0.825).<lb/> PTDM developed in 10.2% of patients receiving fi rst transplant versus 10.2%<lb/> receiving second or more transplant (P = 0.957). Among all patients 85 had<lb/> history of DM in fi rst degree relatives, PTDM developed in 17 (20%) 0f them<lb/> versus 8.8% in patients without history of DM in fi rst degree relatives (0.003).<lb/> Patients divided in to three groups according to pretransplant dialysis duration:<lb/> preemptive (16 ). one to 23 months (444). and more than 24 months (184).<lb/> PTDM occurred in 25%, 9.9% and 9.8% respectively (P = 0.143).<lb/> Conclusions: the older age at the time of transplantation and family history of<lb/> DM were the main predictors for developing PTDM.<lb/></div>
