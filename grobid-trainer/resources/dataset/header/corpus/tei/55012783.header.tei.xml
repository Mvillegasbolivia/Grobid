	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT We examined whether vitamin A improved mucosal immune depression in mice with wasting protein<lb/> deficiency. In male C3H/HeN mice fed a semi-purified 1% protein diet for 2 wk, plasma retinol and immunoglobulin<lb/> A (IgA) concentrations in the small intestinal mucosa were 50 and 55%, respectively, of those in mice fed a<lb/> semi-purified 20% protein diet, (P Ͻ 0.05). Daily supplementation of 0.3 mg of retinyl acetate to protein-deficient<lb/> mice for 2 wk increased the plasma retinol level to the value in the protein-sufficient mice. However, 1 mg/d of<lb/> retinyl acetate was required to prevent the decline of the IgA level caused by the protein deficiency. Mice fed the<lb/> low-protein diet had lower concentrations of IL-4 and IL-5 in the small intestinal mucosa and fewer IL-4-and<lb/> IL-5-containing cells in the lamina propria (P Ͻ 0.05). Retinyl acetate (1 mg) significantly restored the IL-5 level and<lb/> the number of IL-4-and IL-5-containing cells. After immunization with 20 ␮g of cholera toxin (CT), the intestinal<lb/> mucosa of protein-deficient mice contained significantly less CT-specific IgA than control mice. Treatment with 1<lb/> mg of retinyl acetate prevented the decline of anti-CT IgA level in the protein-deficient mice, improving their survival<lb/> rate after an exposure to 0.1 mg of CT. These results suggest that large oral supplements of vitamin A may preserve<lb/> mucosal IgA level during protein malnutrition, possibly by stimulating Th2 cytokine production and thereby,<lb/> inducing resistance against infection.</div>
