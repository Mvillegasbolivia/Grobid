	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> The present work is concerned with the design of an innovative ski-boot. In order to optimize ergonomics<lb/> and biomechanical behavior of the ski-boot it is important to take into account the orientation of the leg<lb/> with respect to the ground. The SGS system (Stance Geometry System) developed in this work allows<lb/> the skier to adjust for posture in the frontal plane by rotating the sole of the boot about the antero-<lb/>posterior axis (ski-boot is then locked in the desired position before skiing). A simplified model of the<lb/> effect of ski-boot deformation on skiing behavior is used to evaluate the minimal stiffness the system<lb/> must have. An experimental analysis on the ski slopes was carried out to provide ski-boot deformations<lb/> and loading data in different skiing conditions, to be used in numerical simulations. Finite Elements<lb/> Method (FEM) simulations were performed for optimal design of the joint between ski-boot and sole.<lb/> The active loads and local ski-boot deformations during small-and large-radius turns were<lb/> experimentally determined and used to validate a FEM model of the ski-boot. The model was used to<lb/> optimize the design for maximum stiffness and to demonstrate the efficacy of virtual design supported by<lb/> proper experimental data. Mean loads up to 164% body weight were measured on the outer ski during<lb/> turning. The new SGS design system allows the adjustment of lateral stance before using the ski-boot,<lb/> optimizing the ski-boot stiffness through FEM analysis. Innovative aspects of this work included not<lb/> only the stance geometry system ski-boot but also the setup of a virtual design environment that was<lb/> validated by experimental evidence. An entire dataset describing loads during skiing has been obtained.<lb/> The optimized SGS ski-boot increases intrinsic knee stability due to proper adjustment of lateral stance,<lb/> guaranteeing appropriate stiffness of the ski-boot system.<lb/></div>
