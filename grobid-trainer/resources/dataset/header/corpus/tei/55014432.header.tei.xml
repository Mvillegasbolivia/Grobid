	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Microorganisms can cause severe problems in oilfield water systems. This paper describes a<lb/> new quaternary phosphonium biocide based on tributyl tetradecyl phosphonium chloride<lb/> (TTPC). Laboratory and field data has shown that TTPC is effective at low concentrations, is<lb/> fast acting and is effective against both acid producing and sulfate reducing bacteria. It has<lb/> out performed both glutaraldehyde and THPS in comparative biocidal tests giving complete kill<lb/> of aerobic and anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria in one hour at 5 and 50 ppm active,<lb/> respectively. Glutaraldehyde required &gt;40 and 150 ppm active and THPS required 40 and<lb/> &gt;200 active to match the performance of TTPC versus aerobic and anaerobic sulfate-reducing<lb/> bacteria, respectively. TTPC is compatible with oxidizing biocides, hydrogen sulfide and<lb/> oxygen scavengers and has excellent thermal stability which makes it broadly applicable to<lb/> oilfield water systems.<lb/></div>
