	<div type="abstract">Near Field Communication or NFC, is a short-<lb/>range high frequency wireless communication<lb/> technology which enables the exchange of data<lb/> between devices over about a 10 centimetre<lb/> (around 4 inches) distance.<lb/> [1] The technology is a<lb/> simple extension of the ISO/IEC 14443<lb/> proximity-card standard (contactless card, RFID)<lb/> that combines the interface of a smartcard and a<lb/> reader into a single device. An NFC device can<lb/> communicate with both existing ISO/IEC 14443<lb/> smartcards and readers, as well as with other<lb/> NFC devices, and is thereby compatible with<lb/> existing contactless infrastructure already in use<lb/> for public transportation and payment. NFC is<lb/> primarily aimed at usage in mobile phones.<lb/></div>
