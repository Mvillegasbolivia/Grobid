	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Cars have been increasingly equipped with technology, meet-<lb/>ing the demand of people for safety, connectivity, and com-<lb/>fort. Upcoming HMIs provide access to in-car systems and<lb/> web services in a personalized manner that facilitates a large<lb/> array of functionality even while driving, with other pas-<lb/>sengers also benefiting from an enhanced experience. Such<lb/> intelligent applications however depend on a solid basis to<lb/> be effective: Personalization, adaptive HMI, situation-aware<lb/> intelligent systems – either of these require semantic knowl-<lb/>edge about the user, the vehicle, the current driving situa-<lb/>tion. Advanced functions coexist with sensors, other func-<lb/>tions, and even other vehicles. In such an environment,<lb/> collaboration can be highly beneficial. Obtaining a com-<lb/>mon understanding of knowledge and providing a platform<lb/> to exchange it is essential in order to reach the next level of<lb/> intelligent in-car systems. This work describes the Automo-<lb/>tive Ontology, which is located at the core of such an open<lb/> platform. We give an overview of design areas relevant to<lb/> automotive applications, as well as meta aspects that facili-<lb/>tate inference and reasoning.<lb/></div>
