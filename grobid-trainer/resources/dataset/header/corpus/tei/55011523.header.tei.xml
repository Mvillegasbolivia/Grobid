	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The effect of recrystallization on the crystallographic textures and anisotropic mechanical properties of Zircaloy-4<lb/> sheets was investigated. In addition, the influence of niobium additions on these properties was studied using three<lb/> different alloys. The mechanical anisotropy parameters were determined by mechanical testing of gridded tensile<lb/> samples. The textures were characterized by X-ray pole figure measurements and crystallite orientation distribution<lb/> functions (CODFs). The CODFs were combined with a crystal plasticity model to predict the anisotropy parameters<lb/> based on the dominance individually of basal, prism and pyramidal slip systems. Good agreement was noted between<lb/> the experimental results and model predictions based on prism slip for the recrystallized materials, while the results<lb/> on cold-worked sheets differed from model predictions for all the three slip systems.<lb/></div>
