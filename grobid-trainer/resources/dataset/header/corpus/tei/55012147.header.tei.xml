	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT: Conductivity has been the simplest, oldest, most common, most reliable and lowest cost<lb/> measurement used for determining water purity. Nevertheless, this lowly measurement has provided the<lb/> means for protecting and assuring efficient operation of billions of dollars worth of power and steam<lb/> generation equipment throughout the world for over three-quarters of a century. Recent innovations in<lb/> measurement accuracy, temperature compensation, and sample conditioning have enabled this basic<lb/> detection method to provide more information and to expand its use even further. From the simplest TDS<lb/> meter to the most sophisticated ion chromatograph, conductivity measurement is the core technology.<lb/> The widespread use of this measurement often outpaces the understanding of it. Provided here<lb/> are the fundamentals and application of conductivity measurement as used in power and steam<lb/> generation, including ionic conductance, cell constant, measuring techniques and temperature effects. In<lb/> addition, various means of sample conditioning are discussed, covering the measurements of cation<lb/> conductivity, degassed cation conductivity, pH and CO 2 calculations and even TOC (total organic carbon)<lb/> measurements. It is hoped this discussion will assist those applying conductivity measurement in any of<lb/> its incarnations to have a greater understanding and to obtain better results.
