	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> High-molecular weight poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLA, M v 85000) was applied as a direct compression excipient in<lb/> controlled release tablets. PDLA powders with good flowing properties were obtained by milling pre-cooled PDLA<lb/> granules. Apparent yield pressure values ranged from 44 to 71 MPa for tabletting speeds of 0.033 and 300 mm/s,<lb/> respectively, pointing to a high ductility and limited strain rate sensitivity. Tablets with good mechanical strength<lb/> (tensile strength 2.5–3.7 MPa) were prepared at different compaction speeds. Dissolution experiments with different<lb/> drugs showed that PDLA exhibited good sustained release properties. Initial tablet porosity, lubrication with<lb/> magnesium stearate and pH of the dissolution medium hardly affected the release rate of the incorporated drug. Drug<lb/> loads, however, markedly affected the release rate. For drug loads between 20 and 50% w/w, a constant fractional<lb/> release rate was found. Upon further decreasing of the drug load, the release rate was found to increase. This<lb/> remarkable finding was explained by the rapid and large increase of the pore volume of the tablets. The results show<lb/> the unique properties of PDLA and its suitability to be applied as a direct compression and release controlling<lb/> excipient in matrix tablets for oral drug administration.</div>
