	<div type="abstract">SUMMARY<lb/> The relationship between exposed galactose and N-acetylglucosamine on IgG in RA, JCA and SS<lb/> was investigated. This was achieved using IgG isolated from serum where the levels of galactose<lb/> and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) were detected using biotinylated lectins. Galactose and GlcNAc<lb/> on IgG from patients with RA and JCA are inversely related, but in contrast, in SS, galactose expression on<lb/> IgG decreased while GlcNAc expression remained similar to normal levels. Alterations in IgG glycosylation<lb/> are closely associated with the development of adult and juvenile chronic arthritis and SS, but the changes<lb/> involved are different in RA compared with SS, suggesting that the precise pattern of exposed sugars is<lb/> associated with different rheumatological diseases.<lb/></div>
