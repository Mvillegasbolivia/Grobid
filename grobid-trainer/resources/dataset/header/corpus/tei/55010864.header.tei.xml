	<div type="abstract">Abstract The electrochemically initiated reaction of p-phenylenediamines with sulfide in aqueous media is well documented.<lb/> We now report the adaptation of this chemistry into nonaqueous media. This is critically appraised as a means of<lb/> detecting sulfide. The electrochemically initiated reaction of N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine with sulfide is shown at<lb/> both macro-and platinum microdisk electrodes with quantitative detection of sulfide produced by means of the<lb/> enhanced currents observed upon its addition. The linear detection range for sulfide is dependent on the<lb/> concentration of N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine present with a linear range from 28 Â± 3290 mM and a limit of<lb/> detection of 22 mM achievable. This represents a large increase compared to that found previously in aqueous media<lb/> and offers the prospect of more ready applications in high temperature systems.<lb/></div>
