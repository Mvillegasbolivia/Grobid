	<div type="abstract">Computer application streaming is a form of on-demand software distribution.<lb/> The basic concept of application streaming has its foundation in the way modern computer programming<lb/> languages and operating systems produce and run application code. Only specific parts of a computer<lb/> program need to be available at any instance for the end user to perform a particular function. This means<lb/> that a program need not be fully installed on a client computer, but parts of it can be delivered over a low<lb/> bandwidth network as and when they are required.<lb/> Application streaming is usually combined with application virtualization, so that applications are not<lb/> installed in the traditional sense.<lb/></div>
