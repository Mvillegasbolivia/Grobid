	<div type="abstract">A systematic study of the relationship between the microstructure of the interface in C/AI<lb/> composites and its dependence on variations in squeeze-casting parameters has been<lb/> undertaken. This research has shown that the amount of AI4C 3 reaction product at the<lb/> interface is dependent on the surface structure of the reinforcing fibre and the surface<lb/> treatment of the fibre. Additionally, the interface shear strength increases with an increase in<lb/> the amount of reaction product at the interface. An increase in interface shear strength leads<lb/> to a decrease in composite longitudinal strength. High-resolution electron microscopy and<lb/> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses indicate that carbide formation is a conventional<lb/> two-step process of nucleation and growth. Nucleation occurs preferentially at graphite edge<lb/> planes on the carbon fibre surface, and growth is restricted along certain matrix planes and<lb/> directions.<lb/></div>
