	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> The idea of using one&apos;s behavior with a pointing device, such<lb/> as a mouse or a touchpad, as a behavioral biometric for au-<lb/>thentication purposes has gained increasing attention over<lb/> the past decade. A number of interesting approaches based<lb/> on the idea have emerged in the literature and promising<lb/> experimental results have been reported; however, we argue<lb/> that limitations in the past experimental evaluations of these<lb/> approaches raise questions about their true effectiveness in a<lb/> practical setting. In this paper, we review existing authenti-<lb/>cation approaches based on mouse dynamics and shed light<lb/> on some important limitations regarding how the effective-<lb/>ness of these approaches has been evaluated in the past. We<lb/> present the results of several experiments that we conducted<lb/> to illustrate our observations and suggest guidelines for e-<lb/>valuating future authentication approaches based on mouse<lb/> dynamics. We also discuss a number of avenues for addi-<lb/>tional research that we believe are necessary to advance the<lb/> state of the art in this area.<lb/></div>
