	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The aqueous extract of Ficus deltoidea whole plant was investigated to evaluate the rate of<lb/> wound healing enclosure and the histology of healed wounds in rats. Five groups of adult<lb/> male Sprague Dawley rats were experimentally wounded in the posterior neck area. Group 1<lb/> animals were treated with sterile deionized water as a negative control. Thin layer of blank<lb/> placebo was applied topically to the wounds of Group 2 rats. Group 3 and 4 rats were<lb/> dressed topically with thin layer of placebo containing 5% and 10% F. deltoidea extracts,<lb/> respectively. Thin layer of Intrasite gel was applied topically to wounds of Group 5 as a posi-<lb/>tive control. Grossly, wounds treated with placebo containing 5%, 10% F. deltoidea extract<lb/> or Intrasite gel significantly accelerated the rate of wound healing compared to wounds<lb/> treated with sterile deionized water or dressed with blank placebo. Histological analyses of<lb/> healed wounds were consistent with the results of gross evaluations. Healed wounds dressed<lb/> with placebo containing 5%, 10% F. deltoidea extracts or Intrasite gel showed significantly<lb/> lesser scar width at the wound enclosure and more fibroblast proliferation, collagen fibers<lb/> accompanied with angiogenesis in the granulation tissue than blank placebo-treated<lb/> wounds. Additionally, no macrophages were seen in the extract-treated wounds compared<lb/> to the wounds dressed with sterile demonized water or blank placebo. These results strongly<lb/> document the beneficial and significant effects of F. deltoidea extract to accelerate the rate of<lb/> wound healing enclosure in the experimentally-induced wounds in rats.<lb/></div>
