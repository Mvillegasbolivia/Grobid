	<div type="abstract">Abstract: This paper analyzes the effect of communication delays on a distance control<lb/> system. The analysis has been made by simulating a Bluetooth link in the control system.<lb/> First, the controller was designed for the ideal case of a hardwired communication link.<lb/> Then, an ideal and a real wireless link have been simulated on the system to analyze the<lb/> effect of retransmissions of a single packet and of multiples consecutive packets. The<lb/> results of the simulation allow us to state that the parameters that determine the<lb/> performance of the system are not only length but also time instant in which they happen.<lb/></div>
