	<div type="abstract">We describe a unique silk protein secreted from the cylindrical silk glands of the spider<lb/> Nephila clavata. This silk is primarily composed of three proteins, whose transcripts<lb/> of approximately 16.0, 14.5 and 13.0 kb are homologous to one another in two termini and<lb/> repetitive units, as determined on Northern blotting. Its overall organization shows<lb/> that it is similar to other characterized silk proteins, including in the mainly central<lb/> repetitive region as well as the non-repetitive N-terminal (166 residues) and C-terminal<lb/> (176 residues) parts. However, up to 90% of the protein consists of highly ordered<lb/> repetitive structures that are not found in other silks. The repetitive region mainly<lb/> consists of several types of complexes and remarkably conserved polypeptide repeats.<lb/> The assembled repeat units (A 1 B 1 ) contain a high proportion of Ala (30.41%), Ser (25.15%),<lb/> and residues with hydrophobic side chains (22.22% for Gly, Leu, Ile, Val and Phe com-<lb/>bined). The presence of Ser-rich and GVGAGASA motifs suggests the formation of a<lb/> b-sheet. The repetitive region is characterized by alternating arrays of hydrophobic<lb/> and hydrophilic blocks. The results suggested that this egg case silk is an exceptional<lb/> protein when compared with previously investigated spider silks.<lb/></div>
