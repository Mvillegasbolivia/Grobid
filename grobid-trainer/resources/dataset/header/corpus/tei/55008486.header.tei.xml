	<div type="abstract">A surface sensitive second order nonlinear optical technique, sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, was<lb/> applied to study peptide orientation on polymer surfaces, supplemented by a linear vibrational spectroscopy, attenuated<lb/> total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Using the antimicrobial peptide Cecropin P1 as a model<lb/> system, we have quantitatively demonstrated that chemically immobilized peptides on polymers adopt a more ordered<lb/> orientation than less tightly bound physically adsorbed peptides. These differences were also observed in different<lb/> chemical environments, for example, air versus water. Although numerous studies have reported a direct correlation<lb/> between the choice of immobilization method and the performance of an attached biological molecule, the lack of direct<lb/> biomolecular structure and orientation data has made it difficult to elucidate the relationship between structure,<lb/> orientation, and function at a surface. In this work, we directly studied the effect of chemical immobilization method on<lb/> biomolecular orientation/ordering, an important step for future studies of biomolecular activity. The methods for<lb/> orientation analysis described within are also of relevance to understanding biosensors, biocompatibility, marine-<lb/>antifouling, membrane protein functions, and antimicrobial peptide activities.<lb/></div>
