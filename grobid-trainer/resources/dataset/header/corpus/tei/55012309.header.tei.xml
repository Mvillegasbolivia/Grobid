	<div type="abstract">A t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student&apos;s t<lb/> distribution, if the null hypothesis is supported. It is most commonly applied when the test<lb/> statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic<lb/> were known. When the scaling term is unknown and is replaced by an estimate based on<lb/> the data, the test statistic (under certain conditions) follows a Student&apos;s t distribution.<lb/></div>
