	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Recent improvements in stay cable systems have enabled the design and construction of longer and<lb/> longer spans. Because these longer spans are more sensitive to loading (wind, seismic vibration,<lb/> traffic), monitoring the loading and observing the structure&apos;s response has become an essential<lb/> condition indicator. Also several older cable-stayed structures are showing signs of damages, often<lb/> caused by wind-induced vibrations and corrosion. Inspection and monitoring can provide confidence in<lb/> structural integrity and enable early detection of potential problems.<lb/> Advitam has acquired a unique experience in the fields of risk analysis, definition of inspection and<lb/> monitoring requirements, design, implementation and operation of monitoring systems for stay cable<lb/> structures. The following paper presents various considerations for the definition and design of structural<lb/> health monitoring systems and inspection methods. It also features actual case studies, with details on<lb/> implementation, advanced software processing, performance and benefits of inspection and structural<lb/> health monitoring systems.
