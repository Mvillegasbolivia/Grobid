	<div type="abstract">Abstract: The development of custom-designed nucleases (CDNs), including zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcrip-<lb/>tion activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), has made it possible to perform precise genetic engineering in many cell<lb/> types and species. More recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated<lb/> (Cas) system has been successfully employed for genome editing. These RNA-guided DNA endonucleases are shown to<lb/> be more efficient and flexible than CDNs and hold great potential for applications in both biological studies and medicine.<lb/> Here, we review the progress that has been made for all three genome editing technologies in modifying both cells and<lb/> model organisms, compare important aspects of each approach, and summarize the applications of these tools in disease<lb/> modeling and gene therapy. In the end, we discuss future prospects of the field.<lb/></div>
