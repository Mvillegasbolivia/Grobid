	<div type="abstract">Stability of pure stevioside and rebaudioside A in carbonated phosphoric and citric acidified beverages<lb/> during long-term storage was observed chemically, microbiologically, and organoleptically. Thin-layer<lb/> chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography were used to follow the chemical degradation<lb/> of these Stevia sweeteners. Some degradation of both sweeteners was observed after 2 months of storage<lb/> at 37 &quot;C; however, there were no significant changes at room temperature or below following 5 months<lb/> of storage of stevioside, or 3 months of storage of rebaudioside A. Exposure to 1 week of sunlight did<lb/> not affect stevioside but resulted in approximately 20% loss of rebaudioside A. Heating at 60 &quot;C for<lb/> 6 days resulted in 0-6% loss of the sweeteners.<lb/></div>
