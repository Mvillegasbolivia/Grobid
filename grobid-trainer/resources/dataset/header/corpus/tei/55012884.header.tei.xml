	<div type="abstract">Product Description RTV615 silicone rubber compound is clear liquid which cure at room<lb/> temperature to high strength silicone rubber with the addition of curing agents.<lb/> This two-component product is supplied with curing agent in matched kits which<lb/> are designed for use at a convenient 10:1 ratio by weight.<lb/> The compound is clear and colourless. It is a low viscosity, easily pourable liquid<lb/> with nominal viscosity ranging between 3000 and 7000 cps.<lb/> RTV615 silicone rubber compound has been used for protection of electronic<lb/> components and assemblies against shock, vibration, moisture, ozone, dust,<lb/> chemicals, and other environmental hazards by potting or encapsulation of the<lb/> components and assemblies.<lb/> The optical clarity of this silicone rubber compounds suggests evaluation for<lb/> applications such as potting solar cells for maximum light transmission and<lb/> electronic assemblies where component identification is necessary or desirable.<lb/> </div>
