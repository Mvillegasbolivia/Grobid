	<div type="abstract">Summary<lb/> When yeast cells growing on a poor nitrogen source<lb/> are supplied with NH~ ions, several nitrogen per-<lb/>meases including the general amino acid permease<lb/> (Gaplp) are rapidly and completely inactivated. This<lb/> report shows that inactivation by NH + of the Gap1 per-<lb/>mease is accompanied by its degradation. A functional<lb/> NPI1 gene product is required for both inactivation and<lb/> degradation of Gaplp. Molecular analysis of the NPI1<lb/> gene showed that it is identical to RSP5. The RSP5pro-<lb/>duct is a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3 enzyme) whose<lb/> physiological function was, however, unknown. Its C-<lb/>terminal region is very similar to that of other mem-<lb/>bers of the E6-AP-like family of ubiquitin-protein<lb/> ligases. Its N-terminal region contains a single C2<lb/> domain that may be a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid<lb/> interaction motif, followed by several copies of a<lb/> recently identified domain called WW(P). The Npil/<lb/> Rsp5 protein has a homologue both in humans and<lb/> in mice, the latter being involved in brain development.<lb/> Stress-induced degradation of the uracil permease<lb/> (Fur4p), a process in which ubiquitin is probably<lb/> involved, was also found to require a functional NPI1/<lb/> RSP5 product. Chromosomal deletion of NPI1/RSP5<lb/> showed that this gene is essential for cell viability. In<lb/> the viable npil/rsp5 strain, expression of NPI1/RSP5<lb/> is reduced as a result of insertion of a Tyl element in<lb/> its 5&apos; region. Our results show that the Npil/Rsp5<lb/></div>
