	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Increasing evidence suggests that circulating endothelial progenitor cells, which are a subpopulation of hemato-<lb/>poietic progenitor CD34<lb/> þ cells, play a critical role in neovascularization and tissue repair. We have tested the<lb/> hypothesis that traumatic brain injury (TBI) could mobilize CD34<lb/> þ cells to peripheral blood and brain tissue, a<lb/> process critical for vascular repair, in a rat model of TBI. Male Wistar rats were subjected to controlled fluid<lb/> percussion. Blood and brain tissue were collected before and after TBI to measure the levels of CD34<lb/> þ cells in<lb/> peripheral blood and to detect their accumulation in the damaged cerebral tissue. Compared with surgery<lb/> controls, CD34<lb/> þ cells significantly increased in the peripheral blood and accumulated in the brain tissue of TBI<lb/> rats. Immunohistochemistry detected new vessels with incomplete CD34<lb/> þ endothelial-like cell lining and an<lb/> increased number of microvessels in the injured and surrounding tissue. The results demonstrate a close cor-<lb/>relation between an increase in circulating CD34<lb/> þ cells in response to traumatic injury and angiogenesis in TBI<lb/> rat brain. They also suggest that transplantation of CD34<lb/> þ cells or augmentation of endogenous CD34<lb/> þ cells may<lb/> be a novel therapeutic approach for patients with TBI.<lb/></div>
