	<div type="abstract">FOREWORD<lb/> The emergency response procedures for the Escape Hybrid and Mariner Hybrid<lb/> vehicles are similar to those for traditional gasoline-powered vehicles with the<lb/> addition of special considerations for the high-voltage electric system<lb/> components.<lb/> The Escape Hybrid or Mariner Hybrid vehicles use a conventional gasoline<lb/> engine in addition to an electric motor to power the vehicle. The energy used to<lb/> power the vehicle comes from gasoline (used by the internal combustion engine)<lb/> and electricity (used by the electric motor).<lb/> @BULLET Gasoline is stored in a traditional fuel tank.<lb/> @BULLET Electricity is stored in a high-voltage battery pack.<lb/> The combination of a gasoline engine and electric motor provides for improved<lb/> performance (V6 performance with a 4-cylinder engine and electric motor),<lb/> reduced emissions and improved fuel economy. The high-voltage system is self<lb/> contained, never needing to be plugged into an electrical outlet for recharging.<lb/> The system incorporates a generator that recharges the batteries during cruising<lb/> and braking.
