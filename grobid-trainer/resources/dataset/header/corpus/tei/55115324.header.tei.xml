	<div type="abstract">Summary<lb/> Electromyographic (EM G) activity of m. rectus femoris muscle was registered from young male and<lb/> female subjects during maintained isometric knee extension at 60% of maximal voluntary contraction.<lb/> The following EM G parameters were analyzed for the entire fatigue time: integrated EM G (IEM G),<lb/> averaged motor unit potential (AM UP) and power spectral density function (PSDF). The results<lb/> indicated a slight but continuous rise of IEM G during the fatigue period. AM UP showed sensitivity to<lb/> fatigue with increase in amplitude, rise time, and number of spikes counted. PSDF was also easily<lb/> affected by fatigue so that the total power density curve was shifted towards lower frequencies with a<lb/> high frequency decay. The mean power frequency decreased linearily as a function of fatigue time. The<lb/> findings suggest that in addition to natural recruitment of new motor units the fatigue is characterized<lb/> by marked reduction in the conduction velocities of action potential along the used muscle fibers.<lb/></div>
