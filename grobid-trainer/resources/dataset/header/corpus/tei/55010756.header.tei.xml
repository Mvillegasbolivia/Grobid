	<div type="abstract">Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of predicting future values of subcutaneous<lb/> glucose (glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid) in Type-1 diabetes patients, exploiting<lb/> information on injected insulin, carbohydrates intake and past subcutaneous glucose samples<lb/> measured by a Continuous Glucose Monitor sensor. Prediction can be used to warn the patient<lb/> of upcoming possibly harmful events, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. In addition, an<lb/> effective prediction is a key ingredient in Model Predictive Control, a technique successfully<lb/> applied in the development of the so called artificial pancreas.<lb/> Derivation of individualized predictors is crucial to cope with the wide inter-subject variability.<lb/> For this reason we explored the application of linear black-box identification methods to derive<lb/> patient-tailored predictors. Together with the mainstream technique in system identification, the<lb/> Prediction Error Method, we investigate a novel and promising nonparametric method based<lb/> on Gaussian regression.<lb/> The considered methods are applied to data collected on 20 subjects, during two 21-hours<lb/> hospital admissions for each subject. One of the major challenges of this problem is that the<lb/> available dataset is short and the glucose-insulin system has very high complexity.<lb/> The quality of the prediction was compared on the basis of three metrics commonly used in<lb/> system identification, namely Coefficient of Determination, Fit and Root Mean Squared Error.<lb/> On a system identification perspective the present work is a comparison of a novel system<lb/> identification approach with the state-of-the-art one on a particularly difficult and relevant<lb/> case of study. The nonparametric technique improves prediction performance and reduces<lb/> computational burden associated with predictor identification.<lb/></div>
