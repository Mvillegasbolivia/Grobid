	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Software applications are no longer stand-alone systems. They are increasingly the result of the<lb/> integration of heterogeneous collections of components, possibly distributed over a computer network.<lb/> Diierent components can be provided by diierent producers and they can be part of diierent systems<lb/> at the same time. Moreover, components change and evolve v ery rapidly, making it diicult to manage<lb/> the whole system in a consistent w ay.<lb/> In this scenario, a crucial step of the software life cycle is deployment|that is, the activities related<lb/> to the release, installation, activation, deactivation, update, and removal of components, as well as whole<lb/> systems.<lb/> This paper presents a characterization of the deployment process together with a framework for<lb/> evaluating technologies that are intended to address the software deployment problem. The framework<lb/> highlights four primary factors that characterize the maturity of the technologies: process coverage;<lb/> process changeability; interprocess coordination; and site, product, and deployment policy abstraction.<lb/> A v ariety of existing technologies are surveyed and assessed against the proposed framework. Finally, w e<lb/> discuss promising research directions in software deployment.<lb/></div>
