	<div type="abstract">Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) express constitutively active forms of the receptor tyrosine<lb/> kinase KIT, derived from oncogenic mutation in the extracullular, juxtamembrane, or kinase domains.<lb/> Constitutively activated KIT signaling induces tumor growth and the tumor malignant phenotype of GIST.<lb/> Glivec (Imatinib mesylate, STI571) which inhibits the kinase activity of KIT, has been therapeutically<lb/> effective in patients with GIST. E7080 is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor against KDR<lb/> (VEGFR-2), Flt-1 (VEGFR-1), FGFR1 and PDGFRbeta with IC50 values of 5 -50 nM in cell free kinase<lb/> assays. E7080 also inhibits KIT with an IC50 value of 100 nM. We evaluated the effect of E7080 on KIT<lb/> activity in GIST cell line. Treatment of GIST882 with E7080 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of cell<lb/> proliferation, with an IC50 value of 35 nM. E7080 inhibited KIT tyrosine phosphorylation in GIST882 in a<lb/> dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 values of 200 nM. E7080 also inhibited downstream events<lb/> following KIT activation including ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, with<lb/> IC50 values consistent with that observed for the inhibition of KIT phosphorylation. Anti-tumor efficacy<lb/> of E7080 in a GIST882 xenograft model also was evaluated. Oral administration of E7080 at doses of 30<lb/> or 100 mg/kg (BID, QDx28) caused tumor dormancy. E7080 at a dose of 100 mg/kg resulted in tumor<lb/> shrinkage that measured approximately 40%, even when treatment was initiated following significant<lb/> tumor growth. The status of KIT activation was examined in GIST882 tumors resected after 2 h treatment<lb/> with E7080. E7080 clearly reduced phospho-KIT levels in GIST882 tumors. Soluble KIT (s-KIT) was<lb/> evaluated as a potential biomarker of E7080 in the GIST882 xenograft model, because it has been<lb/> reported that s-KIT in plasma samples could be used as a biomarker for therapeutic efficacy in patients<lb/> E7080, an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has direct anti-tu...<lb/></div>
