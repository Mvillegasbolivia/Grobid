	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Metrology and control of critical dimensions (CDs) are key to the<lb/> success of nanotechnology. Modern nanotechnology and nanometrology<lb/> are largely based on knowledge developed during the last 10 to 20 years of<lb/> semiconductor manufacturing. Semiconductor CD metrology entered the<lb/> nanotechnology age in the late 1990s. Work on 130-nm-and 90-nm-<lb/>node technologies led to the conclusion that precision alone is an insuffi-<lb/>cient metric for the quality assessment of metrology. Other components of<lb/> measurement uncertainty (MU) must also be considered: 1. sample-to-<lb/>sample measurement bias variation, 2. sampling uncertainty, and 3. sam-<lb/>ple variation induced by the probe-sample interaction. The first one (sam-<lb/>ple-dependent systematic error) is common for indirect and model-based<lb/> CD metrologies such as top-down and cross-sectional scanning electron<lb/> microscopy (SEM) and scatterometry (OCD). Unless special measures are<lb/> taken, bias variation of CDSEM and OCD could exceed several nan-<lb/>ometers. Variation of bias and therefore MU can be assessed only if refer-<lb/>ence metrology (RM) is employed. The choice of RM tools is very limited.<lb/> The CD atomic force microscope (AFM) is one of a few available RM tools.<lb/> The CDAFM provides subnanometer MU for a number of nanometrology<lb/> applications. Significant challenges of CDAFM remain, such as the follow-<lb/>ing: 1. the finite dimensions of the probe are limiting characterization of<lb/> narrow high-aspect spaces, 2. the flexibility of the probe complicates posi-<lb/>tioning control, 3. the probe apex sharpness limits 3D AFM resolution,<lb/> 4. the lifetime of atomically sharp probes is too short, and 5. adsorbates<lb/> change properties and dimensions of nanometer-sized objects consider-<lb/>ably. We believe that solutions for the problems exist; therefore, we will<lb/> discuss the role of RM in nanometrology, current RM choices, and the chal-<lb/>lenges of CDAFM as well as suggest some potential solutions.</div>
