	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> A refined discussion of the near-field scattering of spherical nanoparticles and the electromagnetic<lb/> fields close to the particle surface is given. New results for the dependence on the distance from the<lb/> surface and the angular distribution of the scattered light in the near-field are given. It will be shown<lb/> that the radial component of the electric field leads to striking differences in the phase functions in the<lb/> near-field and the far-field. Exemplary computations are presented for Ag and Au particles with<lb/> different size. In a second part the discussion is extended to assemblies of spherical Ag and Au<lb/> nanoparticles. It will be shown that large near-fields at wavelengths commonly used in SERS<lb/> experiments are obtained for aggregates. In the near-field scattering intensity &quot;hot spots&quot; mark regions<lb/> between particles in the aggregate where the near-field is particularly high.<lb/></div>
