	<div type="abstract">Cubic Boron Nitride Products â€“ cBNMesh and cBNMic<lb/> Cubic Boron nitride, cBN, is the second hardest material after diamond but it has one key<lb/> advantage over diamond: it does not chemically wear in the presence of graphite and/or carbide<lb/> forming elements like iron, nickel or cobalt, for example, during abrasive processing. It is therefore<lb/> the preferred product for machining of ferrous materials. Unlike diamond, cBN is only available as<lb/> a synthesized material, it does not occur naturally. But this means that, like synthetic diamond, it<lb/> can be tailored to provide exactly the required characteristics for the application and key to this is<lb/> the ability to synthesize tetrahedral morphology in addition to the cubic / octahedral morphology<lb/> that also occurs in diamond. It is available from coarse grit down to micron powder and as<lb/> sintered polycrystalline products.<lb/> cBN varies in colour from a light amber colour to a boron rich black colour and this difference<lb/> does manifest itself in a difference in performance depending on the tool type and application.<lb/> For instance, the boron-rich material is often considered more difficult to use in electroplated<lb/> tools since it can lead to overplating.<lb/> NDP markets its range of cBN under the trade names cBNMesh and cBNMic. cBNMesh is available<lb/> from 50/60 to 325/400 mesh and cBNMic is available from 0-0.5 micron up to 40-60 micron. There is<lb/> a variant suitable for all of the bond types commonly used: metal, electroplated, resin and<lb/> vitreous.<lb/> It is available with a 60% nickel cladding for resin bonds or titanium for metal bonds. As a grit<lb/> product, cBNMesh it is used in grinding wheels for a myriad of applications: high stock removal<lb/> OD and surface grinding, profile grinding, surface finishing and sharpening of steel cutters. As a<lb/> micron product, cBNMic is used for lapping, honing and polishing of many components in fields<lb/> of automotive, aerospace and scientific instruments.<lb/></div>
