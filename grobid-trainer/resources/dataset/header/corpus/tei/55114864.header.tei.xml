	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Three-dimensional (3D) panning equipment is essential for the production of 3D audio content. We have already<lb/> proposed an algorithm to enable such panning. It generates the input signal to be fed into multi-channel<lb/> loudspeakers so as to realize the same physical properties of sound at the receiving point as those created by a single<lb/> loudspeaker model of the virtual source. A sound pressure vector is used as the physical property. This paper<lb/> proposes a new method that uses sound intensity instead of the sound pressure vector and shows that both<lb/> conventional &quot;vector base amplitude panning&quot; and our previous method come very close to achieving coincidence of<lb/> sound intensity. A new panning method using four loudspeakers is also proposed.</div>
