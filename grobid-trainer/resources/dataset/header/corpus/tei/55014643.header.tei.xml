	<div type="abstract">SUMMARY A method is described to obtain a new type of microcapsules for immobilization of enzymes<lb/> or living cells. The wall of these capsules consists of several layers of poly(ethy1eneimine) and<lb/> poly(acry1ic acid). The idea is that diverging properties of the whole assembly can be better<lb/> controlled when the membrane is built up by several consecutive steps, each being optimized with<lb/> respect to a special property, for example, permeability or mechanical strength. The encapsulation<lb/> of acidic phosphatase and the cleavage of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was used as a model system.<lb/> The charged capsules were characterized by their enzymatic activity, as a function of membrane<lb/> composition (number and sequence of layers) and storing time. The permeability for the substrate<lb/> and the retaining ability for the enzyme were also measured.<lb/></div>
