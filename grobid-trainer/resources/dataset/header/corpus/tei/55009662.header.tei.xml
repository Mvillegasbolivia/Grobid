	<div type="abstract">Slow sweep rate voltammetric analysis of the Cu/Cu͑II͒ deposition reaction is shown to be an effective tool for examining aging<lb/> effects associated with thiol and disulfide additives that are widely employed as brighteners. Sulfonate-terminated short chain<lb/> thiols are spontaneously oxidized by Cu͑II͒ to form disulfide molecules with the conversion being complete within a few hours of<lb/> electrolyte preparation. An additional aging effect occurs during electrolysis in conventional unseparated electrochemical cells. At<lb/> the anode, the disulfide is reduced by Cu͑I͒ forming thiolate complexes which subsequently affect the copper deposition reaction<lb/> occurring at the cathode. The latter effect may be avoided by using a cation selective membrane to isolate the anode compartment.<lb/></div>
