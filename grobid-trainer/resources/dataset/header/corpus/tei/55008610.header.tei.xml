	<div type="abstract">Abstract: The paper describes the biophore models of sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, triazolopyrimi-<lb/>dinesulfonamide and 5-pyrimidyltriazolo-3-sulfonamides established by the Apex-3D method. A<lb/> series of N-phenylsulfonyl-N &apos;-(thiadiazol-2-yl)oxamides and three types of triazolopyrimidinesulfo-<lb/>namide were synthesised and their herbicidal activities determined to assess the validity of the model.<lb/> In general, the model gave useful leads to activity, although the actual level was not always predicted<lb/> accurately. In only a few cases did compounds predicted as being active prove to be inactive in the<lb/> bioassay, and compounds with little or no activity were clearly indicated.<lb/> As a result of this work, the compound N,N &apos;-[1-(5,7-dimethyl-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-2-yl-<lb/>thio)butane-2,3-di-imino]bis(2-chlorobenzenesulfonamide) was selected as showing good activity<lb/> against a range of species, and will be used as a lead for further development.<lb/></div>
