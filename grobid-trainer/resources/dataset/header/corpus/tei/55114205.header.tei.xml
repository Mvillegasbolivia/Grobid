	<div type="abstract">Abstract A hard, dense, inert rock found world wide, basalt is an igneous rock, wh ich is solid ified volcanic lava. Cast<lb/> basalt liners for steel tubing shows very high abrasion resistance in various industrial applications. In recent years, continuous<lb/> basalt fibers ext ruded fro m naturally fire-resistant basalt are attracted attention as a rep lacement fo r asbestos fibers. In the last<lb/> decade, basalt has emerged as a contender in the fiber reinforcement of co mposites. Some manufacturer of basalts claims it<lb/> offers performance similar to S-2 glass fibers at a price point between S-2 glass and E-g lass, and may offer manufacturers a<lb/> less-expensive alternative to carbon fiber. Basalt fibre (BF) is capable to withstand very high temperature and can act as fire<lb/> blocking element.<lb/></div>
