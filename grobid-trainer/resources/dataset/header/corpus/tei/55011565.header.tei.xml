	<div type="abstract">The objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal<lb/> tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against Clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic<lb/> enteritis in poultry. One of the bacteria isolated, a strain of Bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an<lb/> anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the C. perfringens ATCC 13124 used in this study. The anticlostridial<lb/> factor produced by B. subtilis PB6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase,<lb/> trypsin, and pepsin. In contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by<lb/> treatment at 100 or 121°C or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. The optimum<lb/> growth temperature and optimum pH for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37°C and 6.20, respec-<lb/>tively. Using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anti-<lb/>clostridial factor was estimated to be in the range from 960 to 983 Da. In terms of the antimicrobial spectrum,<lb/> the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of C. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis<lb/> in poultry, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli.<lb/></div>
