	<div type="abstract">BORGSTROM, P., CLEMENTS, L . -k &amp; GRANDE, P.-0.: A servo-controlled roller<lb/> pump for constant flow or constant pressure blood perfusion under normal pulsatile or<lb/> non-pulsatile conditions. Acta Physiol Scand 1981, 112: 4 3 7 4 2 . Received 24 Nov. 1980.<lb/> ISSN 0001-6772. Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Lund, Sweden.<lb/> This paper describes the design of a servo-controlled precision roller pump applicable for<lb/> constant blood flow or constant blood pressure perfusion in research on the peripheral<lb/> circulation. The pump, and its feed-back control, can simulate normal cardiac induced<lb/> autoperfusion by reproducing the arterial pulse pressure confguration with high fidelity.<lb/> Its design is such as to minimize damage of the red blood cells and consequent release of<lb/> vasoactive substances, a problem encountered with most conventional pumps. The present<lb/> pump principle may also find a use in heart-lung machines and dialysis equipment and can<lb/> be used as a precision infusion pump.<lb/></div>
