	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> The calcium release channel (CRC) of the skeletal sarcoplas-<lb/>mic reticulum is rich in thiol groups and is strongly regulated<lb/> by covalent modification of these thiols. Oxidizing reagents<lb/> activate the release channel, whereas reducing reagents inhibit<lb/> the channel. However, most CRC regulators are not thiol<lb/> reagents. Here, we propose that reversible redox interactions<lb/> are involved in regulation of the CRC by nonthiol reagents.<lb/> This hypothesis was tested with several CRC regulators. The<lb/> local anesthetics tetracaine, procaine and QX-314, which block<lb/> the CRC, behaved as electron donors in reactions with dye<lb/> free radicals. In contrast, ryanodine, caffeine, doxorubicin and<lb/> daunorubicin, compounds known to activate the release<lb/> channel, all accepted electrons from dye anion radicals.<lb/> Moreover, release of Ca2+ from SR initiated by doxorubicin<lb/> (acceptor) was antagonized by local anesthetics (donors).<lb/> Based on the redox characterization of CRC modulators, we<lb/> propose a functional model in which channel inhibitors and<lb/> activators act as weak electron donors and acceptors, re-<lb/>spectively, and shift the thiol-disulfide balance within the<lb/> release protein. The consequence of this model is that, in spite<lb/> of the chemical diversity of CRC modulators, a common mech-<lb/>anism of channel regulation involves the transient exchange<lb/> of electrons between the activatorhhibitor and the CRC.<lb/></div>
