	<div type="abstract">The uptake and activation of FXII from blood plasma was<lb/> studied in small-diameter polyethylene tubing, surface-<lb/>modified by end-point immobilization of heparin. Two<lb/> preparations of heparin were used to modify the contact-<lb/>activating properties of the plastic tubing: unfractionated,<lb/> functionally active heparin and low-affinity heparin, lack-<lb/>ing the specific antithrombin-binding sequence and virtu-<lb/>ally devoid of anticoagulant activity. The uptakes of FXII on<lb/> the two heparin surfaces were similar. No activated FXII<lb/> could be demonstrated on the unfractionated heparin sur-<lb/>face, whereas on the low-affinity heparin surface nearly all<lb/> FXII underwent spontaneous activation. The suppression<lb/> of FXII activation on the unfractionated heparin surface was<lb/> investigated by using plasma depleted of antithrombin,<lb/> complement C1 esterase inhibitor, or both. The removal of<lb/> antithrombin resulted in extensive activation of FXII,<lb/> whereas the depletion of C1 esterase inhibitor had only a<lb/> minor effect. Experiments with recalcified plasma showed<lb/> rapid clot formation during exposure to the low-affinity<lb/> heparin surface. After depletion of antithrombin, but not<lb/> complement C1 esterase inhibitor, the recalcified plasma<lb/> clotted in contact with the unfractionated heparin surface<lb/> as well. We conclude that antithrombin and the antithrom-<lb/>bin-binding sequence in the surface-immobilized heparin<lb/> are essential for the prevention of surface activation of FXII<lb/> and triggering of the intrinsic coagulation system. </div>
