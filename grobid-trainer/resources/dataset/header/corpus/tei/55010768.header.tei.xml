	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Social Network applications are gaining momentum. However, equally<lb/> important, privacy is being shown a crucial requirement. Nowadays, privacy<lb/> preferences on Social Network applications consist only on allowing or restrict-<lb/>ing access to information based on attributes of users who are part in the very<lb/> same network. This paper tries to enhance privacy and provide automatic re-<lb/>actions to events via a very flexible specification of privacy policies and the<lb/> reasoning associated to them. In our approach it is possible to include Social<lb/> Semantic data exposed on the Web into the policy definition and reasoning<lb/> process. We introduce the notion of reactive Semantic Web policies offering<lb/> higher control of the communications and interactions among Social Network<lb/> applications and/or its users. We also present SPoX (Skype Policy Extension),<lb/> which is an implementation that allows policy-driven behaviour control based<lb/> on the Social Network and communication software Skype, including the capac-<lb/>ity of automatically react in certain situations based on user-defined reactive<lb/> policies such as, for instance, to automatically deny or let through Skype calls<lb/> and messages based on existing online Social Web data.<lb/></div>
