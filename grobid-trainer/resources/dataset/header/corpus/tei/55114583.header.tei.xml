	<div type="abstract">In the NASA-developed Bosch process, GO2 is reduced with hydrogen to form carbon and water. Cb and methane<lb/> are also formed. Carbon accumulates in the reactor arid water is removed in the recycle gas stream. Normally<lb/> an iron catalyst is used. In this study, cobalt and nickel catalysts were studied to overcome the limitation that<lb/> iron readily oxidizes to a noncatalytlc form and this limits the extent of reaction. I t was shown that cobalt and<lb/> nickel catalysts allow much hlgher exit water concentrations, but still it is not possible to attain the equitibrium<lb/> predicted from assuming the product carbon is @-graphite. I t is postulated that carbon deposits as a metastable<lb/> metal-carbide intermediate and, therefore, water yields are limited by the metal-carbide equilibrium. The effect<lb/> of this carbide route to carbon formation is very pronounced at 700 K and below, but it is less important at higher<lb/> temperatures.<lb/></div>
