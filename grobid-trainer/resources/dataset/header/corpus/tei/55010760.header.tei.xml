	<div type="introduction">The objective of the project is the thorough study and the full exploitation of new X-ray imaging techniques, named &apos;phase<lb/> contrast imaging&apos; [1-9] or &apos;diffraction enhanced imaging&apos; (D.E.I.) [8-14], which in principle allows low absorbing details<lb/> embedded in a similar environment to be seen and imaged with an extraordinary high sensitivity and precision. The system<lb/> needed for such measurements, which consists of a suitable beamline, a phase analyzer and high quality photon sensitive<lb/> detector will be called &apos;Phase Analyzer System&apos; (PHASY) in is depicted in figure 1-3. It works on phase shift effects which<lb/> appear always while x-rays penetrate matter. Simultaneously scattering in the µ-rad range occurs since the scatter angle is<lb/> proportional to the gradient of the real part of the refraction index. Utilizing now the proposed PHASY on the basis of an<lb/> analyzer crystal featuring a narrow reflectivity curve the scatter angle and thus the phase shift can be exploited in order to<lb/> obtain radiographs with tremendously improved signal to noise ratio for low absorbing materials. The applied dose is<lb/> comparable to normal radiography based on traditional absorption techniques or conversely, for the same image contrast the<lb/> dose can be substantially reduced. The striking feature, that objects as small as 50-100 µm with a low absorption coefficient<lb/> can be distinctively visible, even if they are embedded in an environment with similar absorption coefficients, predestinates<lb/> this technique for applications in medicine and biology (see figure 4-9). The detection of micro calcifications and small<lb/> tumors without high dose application would obviously be a very important example (see figure 10). But also for non<lb/> destructive investigations and structure analysis in material science PHASY opens up new possibilities (figure 11). The aim is<lb/> to make this promising technique available for a wide range of applications in medicine and biology by installing it at several<lb/> synchrotron radiation sources, which cover different ranges of gamma energies. In particular it is aimed to install such a<lb/> PHASY also in combination with a X-ray tube (figure 12). This would increase the attraction of this detection system<lb/> tremendously. Up to now the proof of principle for this diffraction enhanced scattering technique was given in several<lb/> pioneering experiments at synchrotron beamlines [6-14]. But a thorough understanding and systematic investigation of the<lb/> influence of the experimental parameters on the quality of the PHASY is badly lacking. This knowledge, however, is an<lb/> essential prerequisite for optimizing the technique and using it with high reproducible and predictable precision in a routine<lb/> application like medical applications. These investigations are also necessary to define the parameters for an installation on<lb/> the base of a compact x-ray source such as a x-ray tube.<lb/> 1.2 State of the Art<lb/> All standard (medical) x-ray imaging technologies, rely primarily on the amplitude properties of the incident radiation, and do<lb/> not depend on its phase. This is unchanged since the discovery by Röntgen that the intensity of an x-ray beam, as measured<lb/> by the exposure on a film, was related to the relative transmission properties of an object. However, recently various imaging<lb/> techniques have emerged which depend on the phase of the x-rays as well as the amplitude. Phase becomes important when<lb/> the beam is coherent and the imaging system is sensitive to interference phenomena. Significant new advances have been<lb/> made in coherent optic theory and techniques which now promise phase information in medical imaging.<lb/> The development of perfect crystal optics and the increasing availability of Europes&apos; pool of synchrotron radiation facilities<lb/> have contributed to a significant increase in the application of phase based imaging in materials and life sciences. Unique<lb/> source characteristics such as high intensity, monochromaticity, coherence and high collimating provide an ideal source for<lb/> advanced imaging. Phase contrast imaging has been applied in both projection and computed tomography modes, and recent<lb/> applications have been made in the field of medical imaging [Ref 1-9].</div>
