	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Staphylococcus carnosus 833, inoculated into sausage meat, increased the level of methyl ketones, which contributed to the cured aroma.<lb/> These ketones can arise from incomplete L-oxidation followed by two enzymatic activities: a thioesterase and a decarboxylase. In this study<lb/> we identified the L-oxidative pathway (through the measure of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity) and the thioesterase activity in<lb/> extracts of S. carnosus cells grown in the presence of different methyl esters. The L-oxidative system was induced by methyl esters and<lb/> highest induction was found with a 12-carbon substrate. It was specific for medium chain length fatty acyl CoA substrates. Its maximal<lb/> activity was observed at the end of stationary growth phase. HPLC analyses of acyl-CoA after incubation of cell extracts with palmitoyl-<lb/>CoA showed that the L-oxidation system released preferentially long chain hydroxyacyl-CoAs, enoyl-CoAs, and acyl-CoAs. The time-<lb/>course of intermediate formation indicated a precursor^product relationship indicative of a model of free intermediates which could be<lb/> further deacylated by a thioesterase. The thioesterase activity was enhanced when S. carnosus was grown in the presence of methyl esters<lb/> with at least 12 carbons and this enzyme was specific for short chain acyl-CoAs. The maximal activity was reached at the stationary growth<lb/> phase. ß 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies.<lb/></div>
