	<div type="abstract">Muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) can differentiate into<lb/> multiple lineages, including haematopoietic lineages 1â€“12 .<lb/> However, it is unknown whether MDSCs preserve their<lb/> myogenic potential after differentiation into other lineages. To<lb/> address this issue, we isolated from dystrophic muscle a<lb/> population of MDSCs that express stem-cell markers and can<lb/> differentiate into various lineages 1,13 . After systemic delivery<lb/> of three MDSC clones into lethally irradiated mice, we found<lb/> that differentiation of the donor cells into various lineages of<lb/> the haematopoietic system resulted in repopulation of the<lb/> recipients&apos; bone marrow. Donor-derived bone-marrow cells,<lb/> isolated from these recipients by fluorescence-activated cell<lb/> sorting (FACS), also repopulated the bone marrow of<lb/> secondary, lethally irradiated, recipients and differentiated into<lb/> myogenic cells both in vitro and in vivo in normal mdx mice.<lb/> These findings demonstrate that MDSC clones retain their<lb/> myogenic potential after haematopoietic differentiation.<lb/></div>
