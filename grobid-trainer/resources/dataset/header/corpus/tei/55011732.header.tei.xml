	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Both the high molecular weight and the low molecular weight variants of urinary<lb/> Y-glutamyl transpeptidase, displayed transpeptidase (pH optimum 8.6) and autotrans-<lb/>peptidase (pH optimum 9.4) activities. Iodoacetamide inhibited the transpeptidase activity<lb/> more efficiently than the autotranspeptidase activity with respect to both variants of Y-<lb/>glutamyl transpeptidase. The high molecular weight form utilized L-glutamine as a better<lb/> acceptor than L-cystine during the transpeptidation reaction whereas the reverse was the case<lb/> with the low molecular weight variant. While phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride-treated<lb/> enzymes retained full activities per se, addition of maleic acid to the modified enzyme was<lb/> found to inhibit the catalytic activities indicating a maleic acid-induced conformational<lb/> change of the modified enzyme.<lb/></div>
