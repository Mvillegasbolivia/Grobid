	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> For many years, phosphor thermometry has been used for non-contact measurements in<lb/> hostile high temperature environments, including large blackbody radiation backgrounds,<lb/> vibration, rotation, fire/flame, pressure, or noise. Often these environments restrict the use of<lb/> more common thermocouples or infrared thermometric techniques. In particular, temperature<lb/> measurements inside jet turbines, rocket engines, or similar devices are especially amenable to<lb/> fluorescence techniques. Often the fluorescent materials are used as powders, either suspended<lb/> in binders and applied like paint or applied as high temperature sprays. These coatings will<lb/> quickly assume the same temperature as the surface to which they are applied. The temperature<lb/> dependence of fluorescent materials is a function of the base matrix atoms and a small quantity<lb/> of added activator or &quot;dopant&quot; ions. Often for high temperature applications, the selected<lb/> materials are refractory and include rare earth ions. Phosphors like Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG) doped with<lb/> Eu, Dy, or Tm, Y 2 O 3 doped with Eu, or similar rare earth compounds, will survive high<lb/> temperatures and can be configured to emit light that changes rapidly in lifetime and intensity.<lb/> For example, fluorescence from YAG:Dy and YAG:Tm was recently observed at temperatures<lb/> above 1400 ÂºC at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) National Transportation Research<lb/> Center (NTRC) in Tennessee. This paper will give research results applicable to the use of<lb/> phosphors for thermometry purposes. Emphasis will be placed on using selected high<lb/> temperature phosphor paints as a heat flux gauge.<lb/></div>
