	<div type="abstract">The traditional view that the etiology of lumbar disc herniation is primarily due to age, gender, occupation,<lb/> smoking and exposure to vehicular vibration dominated much of the last century. Recent research indicates that<lb/> heredity may be largely responsible for the degeneration as well as herniation of intervertebral discs. Since 1998,<lb/> genetic influences have been confirmed by the identification of several genes forms associated with disc degen-<lb/>eration. These researches are paving the way for a better understanding of the biologic mechanisms. Now, many<lb/> researchers unanimously agree that lumbar disc herniation appears to be similar to other complex diseases,<lb/> whose etiology has both environmental and hereditary influence, each with a part of contribution and relative<lb/> risk. Then addressing the etiological of lumbar disc herniation, it is important to integrate heredity with the en-<lb/>vironment factors. For the purpose of this review, we have limited our discussion to several susceptibility genes<lb/> associated with disc degeneration.<lb/></div>
