	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT: A family of donor−acceptor−donor (D−A−D) type<lb/> near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores containing rigid nonplanar<lb/> conjugated tetraphenylethene (TPE) moieties was designed and<lb/> synthesized through Stille coupling reactions with electron-deficient<lb/> [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (QTD) or benzo[1,2-c;4,5-<lb/>c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBTD) as acceptors. The absorption,<lb/> fluorescence, and electrochemical properties were studied. These<lb/> compounds exhibited good aggregation-induced emission enhance-<lb/>ment (AIEE) property, as a result of the twisted TPE units, which<lb/> restrict the intramolecular rotation and reduce the π−π stacking.<lb/> Photoluminescence of these chromophores ranges from 600 to<lb/> 1100 nm, and their HOMO−LUMO gaps are between 1.85 and<lb/> 1.50 eV. Non-doped organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on these fluorophores were made and exhibited EL emission<lb/> spectra peaking from 706 to 864 nm. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these devices ranged from 0.89% to 0.20% and<lb/> remained fairly constant over a range of current density of 100−300 mA cm<lb/> −2<lb/> . The device with the highest solid fluorescence<lb/> efficiency emitter 1a shows the best performance with a maximum radiance of 2917 mW Sr<lb/> −1 m<lb/> −2 and EQE of 0.89%. A contrast<lb/> between nondoped and doped OLEDs with these materials confirms that AIEE compounds are suitable for fabricate efficient<lb/> nondoped NIR OLEDs.<lb/></div>
