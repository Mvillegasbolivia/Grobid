	<div type="abstract">1 . Gener al Infor mation<lb/> Dolomite, composed of calcium and magnesium carbonate (C aC O 3.M gC O 3), has a theoretical composition of 45.65% M gC O 3 and<lb/> 54.35% C aC O 3. In addition to its importance as crushed stone, it has a w ide v ariety of industrial applications. It is used in the<lb/> steelmaking industry as a flux and for manufacture of refractories for basic open hearth furnaces, Bessemer conv erters and steel<lb/> ladles. In the cement industry it is used in refractories w hich line rotary cement kilns. It is an ingredient in the manufacture of plate<lb/> glass and fibreglass, and has agricultural applications as a fertiliser, soil conditioner and stockfeed supplement.<lb/> The specific grav ity of dolomite is 2.85. This means that a pure dolomite w eighs 2.85 times as much as an equal v olume of pure<lb/> w ater. The specific grav ity of a mineral can be used to help distinguish it from other minerals. The hardness of dolomite is 4 on the<lb/> M ohs hardness scale. This means it is harder than a piece of copper ( a penny, for example) and softer than mild steel (like a knife<lb/> blade). The hardness of a mineral is also another characteristic used to identify it from other minerals.<lb/> </div>

	<div type="introduction">2 . A pplications<lb/> Dolomite is used for a v ariety of purposes as it is a v ersatile rock.<lb/> -It is mainly used in the constr uction industr y and is often used as a substitute for limestone.<lb/> -Industrial uses of dolomite include the manufactur ing of glass (the glass manufacturing industry uses pr e-calcined dolomite,<lb/> w hich theoretically contains about 21.8% magnesium oxide, or M gO ).<lb/> -It is used in certain industries, such as the ir on and steel-making industr ies, as a refractory and also as a flux.<lb/> -Dolomite is burnt, hardened and then made into small pellets and heated again. These pellets of dolomite are then used in the<lb/> manufacture of blocks of dolomite refractory. C alcined dolomite w ith added iron oxide is used to repair the inner linings of furnaces. It<lb/> is crushed into a fine pow der called aglime, w hich is used for agr icultur al pur poses (it reduces the acidity of the soil), and in the<lb/> filler -making industr y.<lb/> 3 . C M T Gr oup P r oducts:<lb/> 3 .1 . Dolomite P owder<lb/> Dolomite P owder offered by us is high on demand in the market. We prov ide Dolomite Pow der to the clients as per their<lb/> requirements. Dolomite Pow der is used in Iron and S teel Industry, F erro – M anganese G lass, F ertilizer Industry, and Lime:<lb/> M agnesium M etal, F ertilizer / E xtender and S ea–w ater M agnesia. We supply from Thanh H oa, H a N am region prominently w ith<lb/> adequate serv ice of timely deliv ery.<lb/> 3 .2 . Dolomite Stone<lb/> We offer the finest quality Dolomite Stone that is supplied by us. Dolomite S tone is prov ided to the clients as per their required<lb/> quantity. The dolomite stones offered by us are processed at our units in H a N am and Thanh H oa under the guidance of experts.<lb/> 3 .3 . C alcined Dolomite<lb/> We are reckoned as the reliable M anufacturer and S upplier of C alcined Dolomite located in India. We prov ide natural Dolomite<lb/> Limestone w hich is composed of C aO , M gO , R2 O 3 and S iO 2. C alcined Dolomite w hen combined w ith w ater leads to the production<lb/> of alkaline slurry. The alkaline slurry is w idely used for neutralizing the low pH of acids. The natural Dolomite Limestone offered by<lb/> us is also used for adjusting the pH of the soil so as to improv e the grow ing conditions. It is used for Water treatment, A cid gas<lb/> absorption or C onstruction purposes.<lb/> 3 .4 . Dolomite C hips<lb/> We are exploiting Dolomite C hips from Thanh H oa and H a N am prov ince, V ietnam.</div>
