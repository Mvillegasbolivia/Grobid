	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Improved fracture toughness by as much as a factor of two in infrared window materials<lb/> has been observed after the deposition of thin compressive surface films by reactive ion<lb/> beam techniques.<lb/> The relationship between film stress, film thickness, substrate proper-<lb/>ties, and observed fracture toughness are being investigated, using Vickers indentation to<lb/> determine mechanical properties and a bending plate capacitance method to independently de-<lb/>termine film stress.<lb/> Comparisons are made to a theoretical model developed by Lawn and<lb/> Fuller.<lb/></div>
