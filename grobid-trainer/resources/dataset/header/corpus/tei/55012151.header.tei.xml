	<div type="abstract">Abstract: The paper presents a theoretical and practical study related with the<lb/> implementation of artificial intelligence for the enhancement of water quality<lb/> measurement systems accuracy. The measurement parameters related to water quality<lb/> (WQ), considered in the present work, are essentially the pH and the conductivity (C).<lb/> The fusion of sensor information is performed using two different architectures of the<lb/> Artificial Neural Networks. Those architectures are compared in terms of the<lb/> implementation, complexity of associated digital signal processing and accuracy<lb/> enhancement. An additional measure of temperature is used to offer details regarding<lb/> the presence of micro-organisms in tested water and also to compensate the<lb/> temperature influences on the pH and C measurements. The test environment is<lb/> implemented by a virtual measurement system, which includes a hardware component<lb/> based on a data acquisition board and a software component developed in LabVIEW<lb/> graphical programming language.<lb/></div>
