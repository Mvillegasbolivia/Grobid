	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> AIM: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is one of the rate-limiting<lb/> enzymes in metabolism of arachidonic acid, and COX-2<lb/> inhibitors demonstrate preventive effects on cancer,<lb/> especially on colorectal cancer. The underlying mechanism<lb/> remains unclear. The aim of this study was to illustrate<lb/> the relationship between angiogenesis and COX-2 in<lb/> carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer.<lb/> METHODS: One hundred and seventy patients with<lb/> colorectal cancer were enrolled in our study from January<lb/> 1993 to September 2001 in School of Oncology, Peking<lb/> University. COX-2 and VEGF expression were detected with<lb/> the immunohistochemistry (IHC) technique. IHC assays<lb/> were carried out with the aid of tissue microarray (TMA)<lb/> procedure. Specimens from 35 of these patients were<lb/> examined with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).<lb/> RESULTS: COX-2 and VEGF expressions were stronger in<lb/> colorectal cancer than those in the corresponding normal<lb/> tissues, at both protein and mRNA levels. One hundred<lb/> patients were eligible for analysis after IHC assay of COX-<lb/>2 and VEGF. The positive rate of VEGF was much higher in<lb/> COX-2 positive group (47/85) than in COX-2 negative group<lb/> (χ<lb/> 2 = 4.181, P = 0.041). The result was further verified by<lb/> the result of RT-PCR (χ<lb/> 2 = 8.517, P = 0.003). Correlation<lb/> coefficient was 0.409 after Spearman correlation analysis<lb/> (P = 0.015).<lb/> CONCLUSION: COX-2 may be involved in the course of<lb/> tumor angiogenesis of colorectal cancer and acts through<lb/> VEGF.<lb/></div>
