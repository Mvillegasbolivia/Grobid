	<div type="abstract">A thermoplastic, also known as a thermosoftening plastic,<lb/> [1][2] is a polymer that turns to a liquid when<lb/> heated and freezes to a very glassy state when cooled sufficiently. Most thermoplastics are high-molecular-<lb/>weight polymers whose chains associate through weak Van der Waals forces (polyethylene); stronger dipole-<lb/>dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding (nylon);<lb/> [3] or even stacking of aromatic rings (polystyrene).<lb/> Thermoplastic polymers differ from thermosetting polymers (Bakelite) in that they can be remelted and<lb/> remoulded. Many thermoplastic materials are addition polymers; e.g., vinyl chain-growth polymers such as<lb/> polyethylene and polypropylene.<lb/></div>
