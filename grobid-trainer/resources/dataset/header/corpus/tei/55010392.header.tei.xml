	<div type="abstract">A selenium-based colorant obtained by transferring it into micro-and nanostates by mechanical dispersion us-<lb/>ing the main component of the glass — quartz sand — as the stabilizing matrix is studied. It is determined that<lb/> with mechanical dispersion of SiO 2 + Se mixtures not only does comminution occur but a transition of sele-<lb/>nium into other polymorphic modifications could also occur, while the observation of an increase of the color<lb/> intensity of the glasses synthesized on their basis is most likely due to the stabilization of selenium particles in<lb/> low-dimension voids of the quartz glass. It has been found that a black heterogeneous mixture SiO 2 + Se is<lb/> characterized by high volatility and simultaneously the highest tinting power.<lb/></div>
