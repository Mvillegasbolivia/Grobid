	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> In order to evaluate composting parameters and phosphorus availability of natural phosphate by decomposing organic wastes, four composts were prepared using<lb/> coffee hulls and pulp, (Gliriscida sepium) leaves and branchs, cattle manure and rock phosphate. The wastes were disposed in piles which were turned and watered<lb/> frequently to improve aerobic bioconversion of organic matter. Temperature, pH, electric conductivity and organic matter were evaluated during the composting<lb/> period. Ratio N-NH 4<lb/> + / N-NO 3<lb/> -and C/N, phosphorus availability were quantified at 112 days in the maturation phase. The maximum temperatures (60 -65<lb/> o C) were<lb/> observed 15 days after formed the piles. After 60 days the temperatures did not rise beyond 40<lb/> o C even close to the turning of materials which indicates the end of the<lb/> thermophilic phase. The pH decreases toward the final of decomposition process, regardless tipes of residues. Rock phosphate increases electric conductivity of the<lb/> mixtures with coffee pulp but it decreases in the G. sepium one. At 112 days the substrates with coffee pulp shows pH values (7.9 -8.1) and electric conductivity (2.5<lb/> -2.9 mS/cm) which were higher statistically than these of G. sepium (7.4 -7.5) and (1.8 -2.3 mS/cm) respectively. In the other hand the organic matter percent in<lb/> coffee pulp composts (25.2 -31.1) were lower that G. sepium (30.6 -35.7). It was not posible to determine a clear trend of the organic matter content during the<lb/> decomposition period. At 112 days, N-NH 4<lb/> + / N-NO 3<lb/> -ratio (0.15 -1.2) indicates different maturation grades of the composts, the lowest C/N ratio (7 -9.1) is</div>
