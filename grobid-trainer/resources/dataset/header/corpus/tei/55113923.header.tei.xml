	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> 22MnB5/Usibor1500 is a hot-dip aluminized manganese-boron steel grade that is used within<lb/> the car manufacturing industry and as lasers are increasingly used for welding of the car body<lb/> the amount of research concerning laser welding of this material follows. For thicker material<lb/> the laser hybrid arc welding process has grown to a well-known tool to increase productivity,<lb/> but for thinner materials the advantages are less obvious. In the present research the melt pool<lb/> and wire drop transfer was observed with a high speed camera. Differences between welding,<lb/> with and without the coating were clearly visible and are described and discussed in the paper.<lb/> The resulting welds were examined microscopically and chemically to unveil the composition<lb/> of the material. It is aimed to avoid possible brittle inter-metallic phases directly during the<lb/> process, hence by skipping the usual additional manufacturing step of removing the AlSi-<lb/>coating in advance.<lb/></div>
