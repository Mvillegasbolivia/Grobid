	<div type="abstract">Abstract: Leukocyte adherence mediated by intercellular<lb/> adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) binding to leukocyte function-<lb/>associated antigen (LFA-1) is required for proper in¯ammatory<lb/> and immune function. Inhibition of ICAM-1\LFA-1 binding using<lb/> monoclonal antibodies (mAb) has been shown to be ef®cacious<lb/> at inhibiting lymphoma metastasis as well as leukocyte<lb/> emigration into tissue in a number of in¯ammatory diseases<lb/> such as ischemia±reperfusion injury, septic shock and rheumatoid<lb/> arthritis. In this report, we describe the development and<lb/> characterization of a small peptide antagonist of ICAM-<lb/>1-dependent cell aggregation. By using repeated selection of a<lb/> cyclic nonapeptide phage display library on puri®ed ICAM-1, we<lb/> identi®ed phage that were competitively eluted with anti-ICAM-<lb/>1 mAb. The peptide sequences were determined by nucleotide<lb/> sequencing, and the peptide sequence (C*LLRMRSIC*) (IP01) that<lb/> occurred most frequently was chosen for further study. Phage<lb/> expressing this peptide sequence speci®cally bound ICAM-1 over<lb/> a range of 5310<lb/> 6 to 1310<lb/> 8 phage/mL. A cyclic IP01 peptide,<lb/> linear IP01 peptide, a cyclic nonapeptide with a scrambled IP01<lb/> sequence, and a random, cyclic nonapeptide were synthesized.<lb/> The cyclic and linear IP01 peptides were able to inhibit ICAM-<lb/>1-mediated cell aggregation at a concentration of 1 mM,<lb/> whereas the random and scrambled peptide sequences did not<lb/> alter aggregation. Cyclic IP01 had a half-maximal inhibitory<lb/> concentration of &lt; 970 mM. Cyclic IP01 did not inhibit cellular<lb/> aggregation that was dependent on ICAM-2 or ICAM-3. Alanine<lb/> substitutions in the cyclic IP01 identi®ed at least four amino<lb/> acids necessary for inhibition of ICAM-1 dependent cell<lb/> aggregation; leucine 2, leucine 3, methionine 5, and arginine 6.<lb/> Finally, we showed that cyclic IP01 can inhibit ®rm adhesion of<lb/> neutrophils to endothelium, a critical event in in¯ammatory<lb/> 140</div>
