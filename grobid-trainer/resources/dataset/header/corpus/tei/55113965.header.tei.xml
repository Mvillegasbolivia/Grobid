	<div type="abstract">This paper reviews evidence from the fourteen most recent pricing experiments<lb/> with dynamic pricing. It finds that, on average, customers respond to higher prices<lb/> by lowering usage. The magnitude of price response depends on several factors,<lb/> such as the magnitude of the price increase, the presence of central air<lb/> conditioning and the availability of enabling technologies such as two-way<lb/> communicating thermostats and gateway systems. For the average customer, time-<lb/>of-use rates are likely to induce a drop in peak usage of under 5% while critical-<lb/>peak pricing tariffs a drop of around 10-25%. Customers with central air<lb/> conditioning are likely to display responses in the 15-20% range while those with<lb/> enabling technologies in the 25-45% range.<lb/></div>
