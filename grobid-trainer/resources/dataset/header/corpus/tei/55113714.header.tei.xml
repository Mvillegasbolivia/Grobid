	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> An intriguing question in the matching ofobjects with pauerned injures in two and three dimensions is<lb/> that of an appropriate metric for closeness --is it possible to objectively measure how well an object<lb/> &quot;fits&quot; a pauerned injury. Many investigators have suggested an energy-based meiric, and have used such<lb/> metrics to analyze craniofacial growth and anatomic variation. A strict dependence on homology is the<lb/> primary disadvantage of this energy functional for generalized biological structures; many shapes do not<lb/> have obvious landmarks.<lb/> Some tentative solutions to the problem of landmark dependency for patterned injury analysis are<lb/> presented. One intriguing approh comes from recent work in axiomatic vision. This approach has<lb/> resulted in the development of a multiresolution medial axis for the extraction of shape primitives which<lb/> can be used as the basis for registration. A scale-based description of this process can be captured in<lb/> structures called cores, which can describe object shape and position in a highly compact manner.<lb/> Cores may provide a scale-and shape-based method of determining correspondences necessary for<lb/> determining the number and position of landmarks for some patterned injuries. Each of the approaches<lb/> described are generalizable to higher dimensions, and can thus be used to analyze both two-and three-<lb/>dimensional data. Together, they may represent a reasonable way of measuring shape distance for the<lb/> purpose of matching objects and wounds, and can be combined with texture measures for a complete<lb/> description.<lb/></div>
