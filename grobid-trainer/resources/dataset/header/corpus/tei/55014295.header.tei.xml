	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Caching is an effective mechanism for reducing bandwidth usage and alleviating server load.<lb/> However, the use of caching entails a compromise between content freshness and refresh cost. An<lb/> excessive refresh allows a high degree of content freshness at a greater cost of system resource.<lb/> Conversely, a deficient refresh inhibits content freshness but saves the cost of resource usages. To<lb/> address the freshness-cost problem, we formulate the refresh scheduling problem with a generic<lb/> cost model and use this cost model to determine an optimal refresh frequency that gives the<lb/> best tradeoff between refresh cost and content freshness. We prove the existence and uniqueness<lb/> of an optimal refresh frequency under the assumptions that the arrival of content update is<lb/> Poisson and the age-related cost monotonically increases with decreasing freshness. In addition,<lb/> we provide an analytic comparison of system performance under fixed refresh scheduling and<lb/> random refresh scheduling, showing that with the same average refresh frequency two refresh<lb/> schedulings are mathematically equivalent in terms of the long-run average cost.<lb/></div>
