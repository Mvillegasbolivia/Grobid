	<div type="abstract">Why do I have to bump test my gas detectors?<lb/> This is a common response that many manufacturers and<lb/> industry associations hear when they recommend &quot;bump&quot;<lb/> testing gas detectors prior to each day&apos;s use.<lb/> In the past, the reasons for this may<lb/> have been hard to understand. Without<lb/> quantifiable evidence, the importance<lb/> of bump testing was often lost in a<lb/> deluge of other safety best practices and<lb/> recommendations. A few years ago,<lb/> misleading information about so-called<lb/> &quot;maintenance-free&quot; gas detectors only added<lb/> to the confusion.<lb/> Over the past seven years, we have collected and<lb/> monitored data from tens of thousands of gas<lb/> detectors. A recent analysis of this data has<lb/> produced some surprising results. Now, we<lb/> have hard evidence that supports the<lb/> need for routine bump testing.<lb/> In this paper, we will explore these findings<lb/> and demonstrate the life-saving importance<lb/> of bump testing prior to each day&apos;s use.<lb/></div>
