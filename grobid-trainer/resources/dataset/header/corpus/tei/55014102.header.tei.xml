	<div type="introduction">S<lb/> uccinimide formation in therapeutic protein products is an<lb/> important and common degradation event. Conditions used<lb/> during manufacturing processes such as cell culture, recovery,<lb/> and formulation as well as those used during product storage can<lb/> all influence the extent of degradation. Extensive studies have<lb/> been conducted and published regarding the origin, stability, and<lb/> reaction pathways of succinimide.<lb/> 1,2 Formation of succinimide at<lb/> asparaginyl residues occurs when the backbone amide on the<lb/> carboxyl side attacks the side chain carbonyl group, resulting in<lb/> the loss of an ammonia molecule. Reaction at aspartyl residues<lb/> requires a protonated side chain carboxyl group and is accom-<lb/>panied with the loss of a water molecule. In therapeutic proteins,<lb/> succinimide has been observed to form at significantly faster<lb/> rates in mildly acidic pH conditions.<lb/> 3À5 The rate of succinimide<lb/> formation depends on the equilibrium concentration of the an-<lb/>ionic form of the backbone amide nitrogen, which can be<lb/> influenced by the inductive effect of the side chain group on the<lb/> carboxyl side as well as the local and three-dimensional con-<lb/>formation of the protein molecule.<lb/> 2,6À8<lb/> For monoclonal antibody protein therapeutics, succinimide<lb/> formation in regions of relative solvent accessibility and functional<lb/> importance can have detrimental effects on biological activity and<lb/> requires sensitive detection and accurate characterization.<lb/> 5,9<lb/> Detection of the succinimide-containing variant form has been<lb/> achieved using various separation techniques such as ion exchange<lb/> chromatography,<lb/> 5,9,10 hydrophobic interaction chromatography,<lb/> 11À13<lb/> and electrophoresis.<lb/> 8,14 Upon initial observation of a minor<lb/> variant form, direct identification of the amino acid residue at<lb/> which succinimide formation occurs typically requires the use of<lb/> peptide map analysis in conjunction with analysis by mass<lb/> spectrometry and/or other protein chemistry techniques. A<lb/> significant technical challenge lies in the fact that succinimide<lb/> is relatively unstable and quickly hydrolyzes under alkaline pH<lb/> and denaturing conditions. Conventional peptide map analysis is<lb/> typically performed with protein denaturation and cysteine<lb/> reduction and alkylation at alkaline pH as well as with significant<lb/> exposure to alkaline pH during enzymatic digestion. The highly<lb/> ubiquitous and often mandated use of such sample preparation<lb/> conditions has been recognized as one of the most significant<lb/> challenges in the sensitive and accurate detection of succinimide.<lb/> 5,9</div>
