	<div type="abstract">Abstract: Insect pathogens are an excellent source of novel insecticidal agents with proven toxicity. In particular, bacteria<lb/> from the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are proving to be a genomic goldmine, encoding a multitude of<lb/> insecticidal toxins. Some are highly specific in their target species, whilst others are more generalist, but all are of<lb/> potential use in crop protection against insect pests. These astounding bacterial species are also turning out to be equipped<lb/> to produce a vast range of anti-microbial compounds which could be of use to medical science. This review will cover the<lb/> current knowledge of the lifecycles of the two genera and the potential role of the toxins in their biology, before a more in<lb/> depth exploration of some of the best studied toxins and their potential use in agriculture.<lb/></div>
