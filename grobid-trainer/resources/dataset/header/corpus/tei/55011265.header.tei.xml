	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Multi-user, interactive tabletops are an exciting new form factor to support collaborative group<lb/> activities. To date, much of the research in this area has focused on co-located collaboration â€“<lb/> groups of people seated around the same physical table. A natural step is to connect a co-located<lb/> group working around a table to other remote sites, creating a shared collaborative environ-<lb/>ment. In this paper we present RemoteDT, and initial prototype to explore the space of multi-site<lb/> table collaboration. Our system was designed to exploit DiamondTouch [2], a multi-user, multi-<lb/>technology, but could utilize any table hardware that provides the same capabilities. RemoteDT<lb/> provides three modes of interacting with the table (manipulation, annotation, and telepointers),<lb/> as well as support for connecting to remote tables or single-user devices. We believe our initial<lb/> exploration of the space will serve as a good starting point for future exploration by ourselves<lb/> and others.<lb/></div>
