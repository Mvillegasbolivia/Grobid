	<div type="abstract">Abstract: As interest in plasmonics grows the optical properties of thin<lb/> metal films becomes increasingly significant. Here we explore the<lb/> transmissivity of thin metal films at normal incidence, from the ultraviolet<lb/> to microwaves, and show how, contrary to simplistic treatments, the<lb/> microwave transmissivity may be much less than the optical transmissivity<lb/> for films which are well below the skin depth in thickness. This arises<lb/> because the film is acting as a zero order Fabry-Perot with very high<lb/> reflectivity at each interface. The skin depth then becomes irrelevant for thin<lb/> metal films at microwave frequencies. We also note in passing that the<lb/> expected exponential dependence on thickness at higher thicknesses has an<lb/> asymptotic limit at zero thickness which may be as high as four times the<lb/> input intensity.<lb/></div>

Over<lb/> the past decade there has been a resurgence of interest in this area primarily as a result of<lb/> Ebbesen and coworkers observation of strongly enhanced transmission through holey metal<lb/> films [1]. Further interest in thin metal films has also been stimulated by Pendry&apos;s suggestion<lb/> of using thin metal layers as perfect lenses [2] while at much the same time the same author<lb/> [3] has re-stimulated general interest in the idea of negative index materials – metals, with<lb/> negative permittivities structured to give also negative permeabilities then lead<lb/> consequentially to the possibility of &apos;cloaking&apos; [4]. It is in this context of renewed interest in<lb/> the optical properties of structured metal films that we here revisit the rather old problem of<lb/> the transmissivity of unstructured films.<lb/> There are various standard texts which give expressions for the transmissivity of a thin<lb/> slab of any material. Stratton [5] gives the transmissivity T (Stratton p515 Eq. (24)) for normal<lb/> incidence in air as:</div>
