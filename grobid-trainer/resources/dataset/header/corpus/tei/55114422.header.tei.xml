	<div type="abstract">Quicklime is produced when limestone is heated above 900 Â°C, a temperature at which<lb/> limestone decomposes to carbon dioxid and quicklime (CaO). Quicklime exists in many<lb/> different qualities. Limes of different quality have been characterised, wet slaked and dry<lb/> slaked. The characterisation in combination with the wet slaking suggested that the<lb/> relationship between the surface concentration of calcium and carbon was the best measure<lb/> for the lime reactivity in the slaking process. The higher value for the relationship the more<lb/> reactive was the lime. The wet slaking tests showed that the differences in reactivity<lb/> decreases when temperature is raised or calcium chloride is added to the water. The dry<lb/> slaking tests showed upon very small differences considering the slaking degrees for<lb/> different conditions and different qualities of lime. However the tests showed on a<lb/> relationship between water content in the reactor and the specific surface for the product,<lb/> the higher quote the higher specific surface.<lb/></div>
