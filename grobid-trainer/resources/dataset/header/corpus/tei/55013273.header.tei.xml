	<div type="abstract">Abstract. This paper presents a brief summary of body tracking tools and interfaces the author developed,<lb/> and explains how they have been applied to a variety of interactive art and entertainment projects. The<lb/> purpose of such grouping of techniques and related applications is to provide the reader with information<lb/> on some of the tools available today for computer vision based body tracking, how they can be selected and<lb/> applied to achieve the desired artistic goal, and their limitations. What these computer vision interfaces<lb/> have in common is low cost, and ease of implementation, as they require means which are commonly<lb/> available today to most individuals/institutions, such as computers and small cameras. They have the<lb/> additional advantage that they do not require special calibration procedures, they do not limit body<lb/> movements with cables or tethers, nor do they require wearing special suites with markers for tracking.<lb/></div>
