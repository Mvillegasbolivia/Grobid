	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Acute coronary syndromes result from fissure, erosion or rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. The characteristics of a<lb/> vulnerable plaque include a large lipid pool, an abundance of inflammatory cells and mediators, a reduced smooth muscle cell and<lb/> collagen content and a thin overlying fibrous cap. Potential therapeutic strategies at achieving plaque stabilization have targeted these<lb/> features. Lipid lowering agents, b-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and antioxidants have been shown to<lb/> reduce the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, presumably through plaque stabilization. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors as well as<lb/> macrolide antibiotics and gene therapy approaches show promise in achieving plaque stabilization. The evidence supporting plaque<lb/> stabilization by these agents and the mechanisms by which these agents stabilize plaques are discussed in detail in this review.</div>
