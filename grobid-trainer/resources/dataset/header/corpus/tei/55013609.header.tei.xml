	<div type="abstract">SUMMARY: As the great majority of gastric cancers develop histologically differentiated, and a significant proportion of differentiated-<lb/>type carcinomas progress to become undifferentiated, both histological types are likely to share several common genetic<lb/> abnormalities, such as p53 mutations at advanced stages. However, a subset of gastric cancers develop as undifferentiated<lb/> carcinomas, including signet-ring cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the molecular pathogenesis of this<lb/> tumor type remains largely unknown. To characterize the molecular features of undifferentiated-type gastric carcinomas that<lb/> developed as undifferentiated-type, we examined for p53, APC, and epithelial (E)-cadherin gene mutations, microsatellite alterations<lb/> including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI), and hypermethylation of the E-cadherin gene promoter in 26<lb/> early undifferentiated gastric carcinomas, consisting of 14 signet-ring cell carcinomas and 12 poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas.<lb/> E-cadherin expression was evaluated immunohistochemically. p53 mutations were detected in only one poorly differentiated<lb/> adenocarcinoma sample (3.8%; 1/26), whereas no APC or E-cadherin mutations were found. LOH was present only at D8S261 on the<lb/> short arm of chromosome 8 in 2 of 14 (14%) informative tumors, both of which were poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, and MSI<lb/> was not observed in any of the tumors. No signet-ring cell carcinomas have been found to carry gene mutations or microsatellite<lb/> alterations. In contrast, hypermethylation of the E-cadherin promoter occurred in 69% (18/26) of the tumors; 57% (8/14) of signet-ring<lb/> cell carcinomas, and 83% (10/12) of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, and was significantly associated with loss or reduced<lb/> expression of E-cadherin. Thus, whereas tumor suppressor gene mutation, LOH, and MSI were less common in undifferentiated-type<lb/> early gastric carcinomas, epigenetic inactivation of E-cadherin via promoter hypermethylation may be an early critical event in the<lb/> development of undifferentiated tumors. </div>
