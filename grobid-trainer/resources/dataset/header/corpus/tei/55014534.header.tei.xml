	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Collagen-based biomaterials in the form of sponges (bovine type I collagen, both native and cross-linked by treatment with<lb/> diphenylphosphorylazide, noted control and DPPA sponges respectively) were tested as three-dimensional sca!olds to support<lb/> chondrocyte proliferation with maintenance of the phenotype in order to form neocartilage. Control and DPPA sponges were initially<lb/> seeded with 10 or 10 foetal bovine epiphyseal chondrocytes and maintained for 4 weeks in culture under static conditions in<lb/> RPMI/NCTC medium with 10% FCS and without addition of fresh ascorbic acid. Both supports were always present during the<lb/> study and a partial decrease in size and weight was detected only with control sponges, both seeded and unseeded. Cell proliferation<lb/> was only noted in the 10 cells-seeded sponges (4-fold increase after 4 weeks of culture). Speci&quot;c cartilage collagens (types II and XI)<lb/> were deposited in the matrix throughout the culture and traces of type I collagen were noticed only in the culture medium after 2}3<lb/> weeks and 4 weeks in the case of 10 and 10 cells-seeded sponges, respectively. Glycosaminoglycans accumulated in the matrix, up to<lb/> 1.8 and 9.8% of total dry weight after one month with both seeding conditions, which was much lower than in the natural tissue. In the<lb/> 10 cells-seeded sponges, mineral deposition, observed with unseeded sponges, was signi&quot;cantly decreased (2-to 3-fold). These in vitro<lb/> results indicate that both collagen matrices can support the development of tissue engineered cartilage.</div>
