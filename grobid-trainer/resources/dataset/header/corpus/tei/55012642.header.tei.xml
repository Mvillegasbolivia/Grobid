	<div type="abstract">To examine the special features of the antibacterial effect<lb/> for a thin transparent titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) film, the<lb/> photocatalytic degradation of endotoxin, which is a pyrogenic<lb/> constituent of Escherichia coli (E. coli), as well as its<lb/> bactericidal activity, was investigated. The TiO 2 films were<lb/> prepared from titanium isopropoxide solution, annealing<lb/> at 500 Â°C. The bactericidal activity for E. coli cells was<lb/> estimated by survival ratio calculated from the number<lb/> of viable cells which form colonies on the nutrient agar<lb/> plates. The endotoxin concentration was determined by<lb/> the Limulus tests. When E. coli cells were killed by the TiO 2<lb/> photocatalyst under UV irradiation, the endotoxin from<lb/> the cells was also degraded efficiently. This result shows<lb/> that the TiO 2 photocatalyst has both bactericidal activity<lb/> and decomposing activity for the endotoxin (i.e.,<lb/> detoxifying activity). The bactericidal effect of the TiO 2<lb/> thin film results from both inactivating the viability of the<lb/> bacteria and the destruction of the E. coli cells. This<lb/> feature renders TiO 2 photocatalysts to be applicable to<lb/> environmental protections, especially in medical facilities<lb/> where the endotoxin is needed to control.<lb/></div>
