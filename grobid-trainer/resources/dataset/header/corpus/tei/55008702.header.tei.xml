	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Colossal dielectric constant materials such CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 (CCTO) have recently received<lb/> an enormous of attention because of their potential in technological applications due to<lb/> the formation of internal barrier layer capacitor (IBLC) contains semiconducting grains<lb/> with insulating grain boundaries. Ca 1-x Sr x Cu 3 Ti 4 O 12 (CSCTO) and Ca 1-x Ba x Cu 3 Ti 4 O 12<lb/> (CBCTO) with x = 0.0 and 0.2 ceramics has been doped on Ca site with strontium or<lb/> barium was prepared using solid state reaction technique. X-ray diffraction pattern<lb/> shows single phase with cubic structure. In complex impedance plot for both the<lb/> ceramics show three semicircular arcs represent the grain, the grain boundary and<lb/> electrode effect responses and modeled using series network of three parallel RC<lb/> circuits. Two regions were found in conductivity plot due to the grain boundary at low<lb/> frequencies and the grain at high frequencies. The n value obtained from the fitting at<lb/> the grain region at high frequency dependent are above 0.6 indicates of electron<lb/> hopping conduction mechanism among Ti<lb/> 3+<lb/> and Ti<lb/> 4+<lb/> . The activation energy values for<lb/> CCTO are 0.28 eV and 0.74 eV for grain and grain boundary regions, respectively<lb/> while for CSCTO the energies is 0.27 eV and 0.71 and for CBCTO is 0.31 eV and 0.59<lb/> eV for the grain and grain boundary regions respectively.<lb/></div>
