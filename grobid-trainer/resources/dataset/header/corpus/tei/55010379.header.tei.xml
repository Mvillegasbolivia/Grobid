	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT: Nitrile rubber (NBR), poly(acrylonitrile-co-<lb/>butadiene) or NBR packers, are used to seal oil-well tubing,<lb/> where they often come into contact with ZnBr 2 brines at high<lb/> temperatures and pressures. Under these conditions, NBR<lb/> exhibits accelerated chemical degradation, which results in<lb/> embrittlement and cracking. Although alternative flu-<lb/>oropolymers exhibit excellent chemical resistance, their<lb/> strength is less than NBR, and replacement of the usual<lb/> gasket materials with fluoroelastomers is expensive. We<lb/> have demonstrated that a fluoropolymer surface on a nitrile<lb/> elastomer provides the necessary chemical resistance while<lb/> the elastomer retains strength. This can be achieved by direct<lb/> fluorination, a rather easy and inexpensive process. Samples<lb/> of NBR O-rings were fluorinated by exposure to F 2 and<lb/> F 2 /HF mixtures at various temperatures. Although fluori-<lb/>nation by F 2 produced the desired fluoropolymer layer,<lb/> fluorination by F 2 /HF (hydrofluoric acid) mixtures gave a<lb/> smoother fluorinated layer at lower temperatures and<lb/> shorter reaction times. Elemental analysis showed that the<lb/> fluorinated layer eliminated ZnBr 2 diffusion into the NBR<lb/> polymeric matrix. Surface fluorination also significantly re-<lb/>tarded the loss of the mechanical properties of NBR when it<lb/> was exposed to zinc bromide fluid.</div>
