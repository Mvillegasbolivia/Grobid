	<div type="abstract">Abstract: -Using a biometrics to authenticate a person&apos;s identity has several advantages over the present practices<lb/> of Personal Identification Number stored in smart cards. However, there is an open issue of integrating biometrics<lb/> into the smart cards. Typical verification algorithms by using biometrics may not be executed in real-time on the<lb/> resource-constrained smart cards. In this paper, we propose a real-time automatic face verification system using<lb/> Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to overcome this open issue. In our<lb/> system, face detection and feature extraction steps which require relatively high computing power are performed<lb/> in the host. In the card, not only the user&apos;s feature vector is stored but also the verification step is performed<lb/> without any data leakage. Based on our performance analysis, the smart card can be designed such that the face<lb/> verification algorithm can be executed in real-time.<lb/></div>
