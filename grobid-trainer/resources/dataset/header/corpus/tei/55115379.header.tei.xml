	<div type="abstract">Quantitative assessment of the myelin content in white matter (WM) using MRI has become a useful tool for in-<lb/>vestigating myelin-related diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Myelin water fraction (MWF) maps can be<lb/> estimated pixel-by-pixel by a determination of the T 2 or T 2 ⁎ spectrum from signal decay measurements at each<lb/> individual image pixel. However, detection of parameters from the measured decay curve, assuming a combina-<lb/>tion of smooth multi-exponential curves, results in a nonlinear and seriously ill-posed problem. In this paper, we<lb/> propose a new method to obtain a stable MWF map robust to the presence of noise while sustaining sufficient<lb/> resolution, which uses weighted combinations of measured decay signals in a spatially independent neighbor-<lb/>hood to combine tissues with similar relaxation parameters. To determine optimal weighting factors, we define<lb/> a spatially independent neighborhood for each pixel and a distance with respect to decay rates that effectively<lb/> includes pixels with similar decay characteristics, and which therefore have similar relaxation parameters. We<lb/> recover the MWF values by using optimally weighted decay curves. We use numerical simulations and in vitro<lb/> and in vivo experimental brain data scanned with a multi-gradient-echo sequence to demonstrate the feasibility<lb/> of our proposed algorithm and to highlight its advantages compared to the conventional method.<lb/></div>
