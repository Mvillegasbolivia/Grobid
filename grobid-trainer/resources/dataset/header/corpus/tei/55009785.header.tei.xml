	<div type="abstract">Abstract. We discover and experiment with categorization-based meth-<lb/>ods to natural language identification. Two approaches to language iden-<lb/>tification based on Markov processes are compared, both methods treat<lb/> the incoming text on the character level. We performed series of experi-<lb/>ments with the aim to make certain of high precision in language identi-<lb/>fication task of selected methods and also with the objective to compare<lb/> them against themselves. Experimental evaluation was based on large-<lb/>scaled Multilingual Reuters Corpus with various European and Slavic<lb/> languages. Our research results showed that both methods are compara-<lb/>ble in the task of natural language identification achieving recall as high<lb/> as 99,75%.<lb/></div>
