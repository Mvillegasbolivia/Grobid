	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> The amount of solar radiation emerging from the top of the atmosphere is strongly influenced by the<lb/> reflectance of the underlying surface. For this reason, some information about the magnitude and the<lb/> spectral variability of the surface reflectance typically has to be included in the retrieval of atmospheric<lb/> parameters from reflected solar radiation measurements. Sufficient information about the surface reflec-<lb/>tance properties is rarely available, and the integration of this effect in the retrieval might turn out to be a<lb/> challenge, especially for broadband instruments. In this paper the focus is on the Measurements of Pollution<lb/> in the Troposphere (MOPITT) remote sensing instrument. Theoretical studies are performed to investigate<lb/> how a spectrally varying surface reflectance might impact the retrieval of the total column amount of<lb/> methane from MOPITT radiance measurements, and the current findings are compared to observed biases.<lb/> However, the findings present herein might be valuable and applicable for other remote sensing instruments<lb/> that are sensitive to the amount of solar radiation reflected from the earth&apos;s surface.<lb/></div>
