	<div type="abstract">Abstract. The future terrestrial television broadcasting system should support the transmission of a digital HDTV<lb/> signal with a high spectral efficiency. In addition, this system should maintain graceful degradation as the actual<lb/> analog systems, and should be compatible with the SDTV. The system compatibility can be achieved by using a<lb/> hierarchical HDTV source-coding scheme that can provide at least two (HDTV, SDTV) or three (HDTV, EDTV,<lb/> SDTV) hierarchy levels: SDTV image quality will be expected for portable receivers, and HDTV/EDTV image<lb/> quality will destinate to stationary receivers with roof-top antennas. Taking into account the receivers&apos; antenna<lb/> gains and the different channel conditions, there will be a difference of 25-30 dB between the received powers of<lb/> the stationary and the portable receivers. Therefore, the design of a powerful and a suitable transmission scheme<lb/> for the future broadcasting of the digital HDTV signal will be a technological challenge. In this article we describe<lb/> a concept of a flexible reconfigurable hierarchical digital terrestrial TV broadcasting system for clear and taboo<lb/> channels. The flexibility of the proposed scheme easily permits the receivers to support different reconfigurable<lb/> modes: One HDTV program or multi-programming EDTV or SDTV (for fixed receivers up to 5 x SDTV in clear<lb/> and up to 2 x SDTV in taboo channels; for portable receivers up to 2 x SDTV.) The system achieves a high<lb/> interoperability with the Satellite Baseline system. It maintains a graceful degradation and provides a hierarchical<lb/> complexity. It is based on a concatenated coding scheme. The inner code of the concatenated coding scheme<lb/> is combined with multi-resoIution modulation. The basic constellation is a 64-QAM, which will be operated in<lb/> clear charmels. It can be reconfigured to a 16-QAM in the case of taboo channels. The principle of OFDM with<lb/> very rugged frequency/time synchronization mechanisms is used to combat the frequency selectivity and the<lb/> co-channel interference (CCI) in the channel. Known pilot symbols are sent regularly in order to perform coherent<lb/> detection.<lb/></div>
