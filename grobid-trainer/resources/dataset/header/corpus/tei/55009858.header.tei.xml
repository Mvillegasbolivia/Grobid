	<div type="abstract">Results obtained with multichannel installation created for long-term studies of various<lb/> processes, are collated with the data published by J.H. Jenkins and E.Fischbach, who found a<lb/> decrease of<lb/> 54<lb/> Mn radioactivity near the time of series of solar flares between 5 and 17 December<lb/> 2006. Analysis of the data from our installation in December 2006 has not revealed any<lb/> deviations from the usual behaviour of the count rates for<lb/> 90<lb/> Sr<lb/> 90<lb/> Y,<lb/> 60<lb/> Co and<lb/> 239<lb/> Pu sources. The<lb/> same can be said of the data collected during the period of highly powerful solar flares between<lb/> 19 October and 4 November 2003. Apparent drops in the count rate were detected between 10<lb/> and 12 May 2002 while registering the activity of<lb/> 60<lb/> Co and on 19 and 20 June 2004 for<lb/> 90<lb/> Sr-<lb/>90<lb/> Y source. Around the time of these events, no observations of large solar flares were reported.<lb/> Thus, proposed link between the drop in the rates of radioactive decay and appearance of solar<lb/> flares could not be confirmed. From obtained outcomes follows, that the radioactivity drop<lb/> effect, if it really exists, is rather rare, and that the reason calling this effect unequally influences<lb/> various radioactive sources.<lb/></div>
