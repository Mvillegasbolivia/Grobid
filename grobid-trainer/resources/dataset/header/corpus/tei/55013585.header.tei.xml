	<div type="abstract">Abstractâ€” We propose a peer-driven video streaming system<lb/> that provides a reliable and high-performance video on-demand<lb/> service. We encode each video into multiple low bit-rate sub-<lb/>streams and distribute copies of the sub-streams from the<lb/> participating peers. Each client receives the constituent multiple<lb/> sub-streams from different serving peers, and combines them into<lb/> the original video stream. When a server peer disconnects, the<lb/> system attempts to find a replacement peer that has a copy of the<lb/> missing sub-stream and has sufficient available uplink bandwidth.<lb/> We consider using multiple description coding and layered coding<lb/> to generate the multiple sub-streams. We develop a traffic<lb/> theory for peer-driven video streaming, and examine the system<lb/> performance analytically and via simulation. We show that peer-<lb/>driven video distribution can provide excellent performance even<lb/> if peers disconnect from the network frequently. We also compare<lb/> the performance of layered coding with multiple description<lb/> coding.<lb/></div>
