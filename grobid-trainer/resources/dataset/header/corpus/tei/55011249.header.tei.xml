	<div type="abstract">Two new series of N-alkyl derivatives of 4-aminoquinoline and 4-<lb/>aminoquinaldine are described. Compounds in both series show<lb/> antibacterial and protein precipitating properties and it has been<lb/> possible to correlate bactericidal action and protein precipitation for<lb/> homologous members of the series. The bacteriostatic activity of both<lb/> series of compounds is characterised by maxima at C = 12 to 14, with<lb/> a marked decrease in potency at longer chain lengths. The bactericidal<lb/> activity differs from this in that activity is not greatly diminished with<lb/> the higher homologues. The 4-aminoquinaldinium salts are slightly<lb/> more potent bactericidal agents than the corresponding 4-amino-<lb/>quinolinium compounds. It is concluded that the mechanism of the<lb/> antibacterial action of these derivatives may be closely related to the<lb/> means by which they interact with proteins.<lb/> THE antimicrobial activity of certain polymethylene heterocyclic bis-<lb/>quaternary ammonium salts has been described on a number of occasions<lb/>(Collier, Potter and Taylor, 1953, 1955 ; Babbs, Collier, Austin, Potter<lb/> and Taylor, 1956; Austin, Potter and Taylor, 1958; Austin, Lunts, Potter<lb/> and Taylor, 1959)</div>
