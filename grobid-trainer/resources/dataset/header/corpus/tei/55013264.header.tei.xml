	<div type="abstract">PM01183 is a new alkaloid that binds to the minor groove of DNA and causes cell cycle perturbations mainly<lb/> consisting in a delayed progression of S phase and cycle arrest in G 2 M. Concentration between 0.2 and 10 nM are<lb/> the IC 50 values in most cancer cell lines investigated. The importance of the different mechanism of DNA repair for<lb/> PM001183 was investigated by comparing the drug cytotoxicity in CHO derived isogenic cell lines with normal DNA<lb/> repair function or with impaired Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Homologous Recombination (HR) or Non<lb/> Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) and in human XPA+/+ and XPA-/-cell lines. PM 01183 was three-four time less<lb/> potent in NER deficient cells whereas it was one hundred time more potent in HR deficient cells. These results<lb/> indicate a pattern of activity of PM01183 different from that of conventional alkylating agents. Finally, PM01183 was<lb/> also evaluated for in vivo activity, by using the M5076 sarcoma model that spontaneously metastasizes in the liver of<lb/> C57Bl/6 female tumor bearing mice. PM01183 was intravenously administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day (0.6<lb/> mg/m2/day) for 3 consecutive weeks. Results showed marginal activity as evaluated by tumor growth inhibition (T/C,<lb/> 73.4 % on Day 39). However, PM01183 statistically significantly reduced the number of liver metastasis compared to<lb/> placebo-treated animals (Median&lt;5 and 124 for PM01183 and placebo groups, respectively). Further studies are on<lb/> going in human ovarian cancer and human sarcoma xenografts.</div>
