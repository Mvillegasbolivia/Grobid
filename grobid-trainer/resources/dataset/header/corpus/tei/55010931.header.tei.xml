	<div type="introduction">Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD), known also as a striatal do-<lb/>pamine (DA) deficiency syndrome, is a degenerative dis-<lb/>order of the CNS characterized by akinesia, muscular ri-<lb/>gidity, tremor at rest, and postural abnormalities. In early<lb/> stages of PD, there appears to be compensatory increase<lb/> in the number of DA receptors to accommodate the initial<lb/> loss of DA neurons. As the disease progresses, the num-<lb/>ber of DA receptors decreases, apparently due to the con-<lb/>comitant degeneration of DA target sites on striatal neu-<lb/>rons. The loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD results in<lb/> enhanced metabolism of DA, augmenting the formation of<lb/> H 2 O 2 , thus leading to generation of highly neurotoxic hy-<lb/>droxyl radicals (@BULLETOH). Free radicals can also be generated<lb/> by 6-OHDA or MPTP, which destroys striatal dopaminer-<lb/>gic neurons causing PD in experimental animals and hu-<lb/>mans.<lb/> PD is characterized by degeneration of pigmented neu-<lb/>ronal systems of the brain stem variably associated with<lb/> pathology in non-nigral systems causing multiple neu-<lb/>romediator dysfunctions. The principal cytoskeletal pa-<lb/>thology of PD is the Lewy body, which, in 85-100% of<lb/> cases, occurs in many aminergic and other subcortical<lb/> nuclei, spinal cord, sympathetic ganglia, and less fre-<lb/>quently in cerebral cortex, myenteric plexuses, and adre-<lb/>nal medulla.</div>
