	<div type="abstract">Abstract Multi-spectral recording systems are used in numerous applications ranging from quality as-<lb/>surance over biometrics to remote sensing. This paper reports on the feasibility of a LED-based<lb/> multi-spectral imaging system where the spectral characteristics of the illumination is changed<lb/> by activating different LEDs. The multi-spectral images are captured by a cost-efficient CCD<lb/> camera. We focus here on applying methods from sensor fusion to increase the classification<lb/> performance. Various features are generated from the different channels of the multi-spectral<lb/> images. The most discriminative features are then selected by a forward selection strategy. We<lb/> demonstrate our feature-based approach in human vein detection. Various test data have been<lb/> recorded by our prototype of the LED-based multi-spectral capturing system and have served<lb/> as basis for the experimental evaluation. A detection performance of at least 96 % has been<lb/> achieved.<lb/></div>
