	<div type="abstract">Conductivities and dielectric constant measurements in water at 25 °C have been made on the amphiphilics<lb/> sodium n-dodecyl sulfate, n-dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and chlorpromazine hydrochloride. By<lb/> using the conductivity/concentration data, critical micelle concentrations (cmc) have been determined by<lb/> applying the Williams definition and two forms of the Phillips method. This first Phillips form consists<lb/> of an approximation to Gaussians of the second derivative of the conductivity/concentration data followed<lb/> by two consecutive integrations. The second form, which is proposed here, consists of the application of<lb/> a combination of the Runge-Kutta numerical integrations method and the Levenberg-Marquardt least-<lb/>squares fitting algorithm. The proposed method permits the determination of the cmc in systems with<lb/> low aggregation numbers and with slow variations of physical property/concentration curves allowing the<lb/> determination of the so-called second cmc. A comparative study with results obtained by dielectric constant<lb/> measurements has been carried out. With this new technique, the cmc&apos;s (first and second) are directly<lb/> obtained as singular points in the dielectric constant/concentration curves, and thus, this technique is an<lb/> alternative to the determination of cmc&apos;s from conductivities.<lb/></div>
