	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> A method for determining the isomerization of Asp residues in proteins is described and demonstrated by quantifying<lb/> the isomerization of Asp<lb/> 151 in recombinant human aA-crystallin. First, four types of dodecapeptide fragment<lb/> ( 146 IQTGLD<lb/> 151 ATHAER<lb/> 157 ) in which the Asp residue was either L-Asp, D-Asp, L-isoAsp or D-isoAsp were<lb/> synthesized, and RP-HPLC conditions were established for their separation. Next, the Asp<lb/> 151 -containing peptide<lb/> fragments isolated from the tryptic hydrolysate of recombinant aA-crystallin were analyzed under these conditions.<lb/> New peaks, the retention times of which were the same as those of peptides containing D-Asp, L-isoAsp and D-isoAsp,<lb/> were generated when aA-crystallin was incubated for 140 days at 37 8C. An amino acid composition, amino acid<lb/> sequence, and enantiomeric analysis revealed that two peaks with retention times identical to those of peptides<lb/> containing L-isoAsp and D-isoAsp represented dodecapeptide fragments containing L-isoAsp<lb/> 151 and D-isoAsp<lb/> 151 ,<lb/> respectively. RP-HPLC analysis under other condition suggested that the peak with retention time identical to that of<lb/> peptide containing D-Asp represented dodecapeptide fragments containing D-Asp<lb/> 151 . The present method does not<lb/> require acid hydrolysis, which generates further isomerization products as artifacts, and thus make possible the sensitive<lb/> quantification of each type of Asp isomer individually at a specific site in a protein. In our analysis of the Asp<lb/> 151 residue<lb/> in human aA-crystallin, the degree of isomerization from L-Asp to D-Asp can be determined to a level as low as 0.3%.<lb/> #</div>
