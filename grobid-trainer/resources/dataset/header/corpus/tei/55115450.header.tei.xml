	<div type="abstract">A desalter is a process unit on an oil refinery that removes salt from the crude oil. The salt is dissolved<lb/> in the water in the crude oil, not in the crude oil itself. The desalting is usually the first process in crude<lb/> oil refining. The salt content after the desalter is usually measured in PTB -pounds of salt per thousand<lb/> barrels of crude oil. [1] Another specification is Basic sediment and water<lb/> The term desalter may also refer to a water desalination facility used to treat brackish water from<lb/> agricultural runoff. This may be done either to produce potable water for human or animal consumption,<lb/> or to reduce the salinity of river water prior to its crossing an international border, usually to comply<lb/> with the terms of a treaty. Desalters are also used to treat groundwater reservoirs in areas impacted by<lb/> cattle feedlots and dairies.<lb/></div>
