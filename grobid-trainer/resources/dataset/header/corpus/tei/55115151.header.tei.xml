	<div type="abstract">Much of the pegotmance still to be gained in proton exchange membranefuel cells (PEMFCs)<lb/> in use today is available from improvements to the cathode, traditionally made from unsupported<lb/> or carbon-supported platinum. The search for improved cathode electrocatalysts has resulted<lb/> in the development ofplatinum alloys which iftailored to the desired stack operating conditions<lb/> can double the activiry for oxygen reduction. Recently advances have been made in cathode<lb/> design which have raised perjormance levels in PEMFCs. The new electrocatalysts and cathode<lb/> designs have increased electrical eficienc.y and power densities to the PEMFC stack, needed<lb/> for commercial use. Improvements have also been achieved at the anode, by developments<lb/> in platinum-ruthenium anodes for carbon monoxide and cell reversal tolerance. In this first<lb/> paper; new cathode materials and designs are discussed; a second paper to be published in<lb/> the April issue will look at anode advances.<lb/></div>
