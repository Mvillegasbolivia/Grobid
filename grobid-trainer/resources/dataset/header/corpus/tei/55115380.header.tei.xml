	<div type="abstract">Abstract: Excipients are an integral part of any drug delivery system and though the market is flooded with an array of<lb/> excipients for widely different applications, cost is a major deterrent, especially in a country like India. The objective of<lb/> the present study was to investigate indigenous plant sources containing polysaccharides, devise a cost effective<lb/> extraction procedure and evaluate its use as a multi-functional excipient. Psyllium seed husk has been traditionally used<lb/> as a bulk laxative in India. Recent studies have also pointed out their cholesterol lowering effect. However the<lb/> mucilaginous components of the seeds have not yet been investigated as a pharmaceutical excipient. In the present<lb/> research, spray dried extract obtained from psyllium seeds was used. Paracetamol was selected as drug and mucilage of<lb/> psyllium polysaccharide (PPS) were prepared in different concentrations. The rheological properties of the mucilage<lb/> were studied and important parameters like thixotropic nature, hysteresis loop were observed. The results were<lb/> compared with standard suspending agent sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na CMC). Paracetamol suspension was<lb/> prepared and evaluated for pH, viscosity, resuspendability and sedimentation volume. The Psyllium polysaccharide<lb/> (PPS) mucilage was found to have a promising potential for its use as a suspending agent.<lb/></div>
