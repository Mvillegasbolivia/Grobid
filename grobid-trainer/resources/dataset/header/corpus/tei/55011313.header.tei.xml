	<div type="abstract">Multimedia watermarking technology has evolved very quickly<lb/> during the last few years. A digital watermark is information<lb/> that is imperceptibly and robustly embedded in the host data<lb/> such that it cannot be removed. A watermark typically contains<lb/> information about the origin, status, or recipient of the host<lb/> data. In this tutorial paper, the requirements and applications<lb/> for watermarking are reviewed. Applications include copyright<lb/> protection, data monitoring, and data tracking. The basic concepts<lb/> of watermarking systems are outlined and illustrated with proposed<lb/> watermarking methods for images, video, audio, text documents,<lb/> and other media. Robustness and security aspects are discussed in<lb/> detail. Finally, a few remarks are made about the state of the art<lb/> and possible future developments in watermarking technology.<lb/></div>
