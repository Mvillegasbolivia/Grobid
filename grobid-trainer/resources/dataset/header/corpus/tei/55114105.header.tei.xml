	<div type="abstract">P-cadherin is one member of the classical cadherin family and plays a critical role in tumor cell-cell and cell-stroma<lb/> adhesions. Up-regulation of P-cadherin has been frequently reported in major tumors such as colon, lung, breast,<lb/> pancreatic and bladder cancers. Here we report the in vivo antitumor activity of PF-03732010, a human IgG1 mAb that<lb/> binds to both human and mouse P-cadherin with high affinity and selectivity. Antitumor acitivity of PF-03732010 was<lb/> assessed in orthotopic or ectopic xenografts models including 1) PC-3M-luc-P-Cad 2) MDA-MB-435-luc-P-Cad<lb/> subrenal capsule model (SRC) and 3) MDA-MB-435-luc-P-Cad experimental metastasis model. Surgically implanted<lb/> tumor models are inaccessible to traditional caliper measurements; therefore, bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was<lb/> applied to evaluate the antitumor activity of PF-03732010. PC3M-luc-PCad and MDA-MB-435-HAL-luc-PCad cells<lb/> were stably transfected to constitutively express luciferase and overexpress P-Cadherin. PF-03732010 (5 and 20<lb/> mg/kg) displayed significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 57% and 73% respectively in the PC3M-luc-PCad<lb/> model. In addition, BLI revealed PF-03732010 at 5 and 20 mg/kg inhibited lymph node metastases. In MDA-MB-<lb/>435-HAL-luc-PCad SRC model, distant metastasis in the lungs can be visualized the 4<lb/> th week after the tumor implant.<lb/> PF-03732010 (10, 20 &amp; 40 mg/kg) showed significant antitumor activity in MDA-MB-435-HAL-luc-PCad SRC<lb/> model with TGI of 51.8%, 66.5% and 68.0% respectively against the primary tumor; and antimetastatic activity of<lb/> 54.2%, 72.8% and 82.2% respectively against the tumor burden in the lungs. Kaplan-Meier survival plot showed that<lb/> PF-03732010 significantly improved mouse medium survival time compared to the vehicle treated group. IHC<lb/> examination of MDA-MB-435-HAL-luc-PCad SRC tumors showed a dose-dependent decrease in Î²-actin and Ki67,<lb/> suggesting antitumor activity is a result of cytoskeletal disruption and reduced proliferation due to PF-03732010<lb/> blockade of P-cadherin signaling. We further evaluated the antimetastatic activity of PF-03732010 in an experimental<lb/> model of metastasis, IV delivery of MDA-MB-435-HAL-luc-PCad cells to mice. When mice were treated with<lb/> PF-03732010 either twenty-four hours before or 14 days after injection of tumor cells, PF-03732010 (20 mg/kg)<lb/> significantly inhibited metastases and tumor burden increase in lungs (TGI 93% and 87% respectively) with a<lb/> concomitant increase in median survival of 39 and 19 days respectively. Overall, PF-03732010 consistently<lb/> demonstrated significant antitumor activity, reduction in metastatic burden and improvement in survival.
