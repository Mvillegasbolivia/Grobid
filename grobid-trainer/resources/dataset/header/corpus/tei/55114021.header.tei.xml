	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Intensive care medicine is a large share of the health<lb/> care budget, and in the last decade there has been an<lb/> increasing focus on making intensive care medicine more<lb/> cost-effective by the efficient use of resources while still<lb/> providing the best outcome for critically-ill patients. One<lb/> important set of tools to perform this are critical illness<lb/> severity assessment scores such as Simplified Acute<lb/> Physiology score (SAPS-I) which help clinicians<lb/> prioritize resources and determine the appropriate<lb/> diagnostic/therapeutic plan for each patient. These scores<lb/> are also used for assessing how medications, care<lb/> guidelines, surgery, and other interventions impact<lb/> mortality in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. In an<lb/> attempt to develop an improved patient-specific<lb/> prediction of in-hospital mortality, we propose an<lb/> algorithm based on logistic regression and Hidden-<lb/>Markov model using vital signs (vitals), laboratory values<lb/> (labs) and fluid measurements that are commonly<lb/> available in ICUs. The algorithm was trained on 4000<lb/> ICU patient records and was validated on two sets of<lb/> unseen test data of 4000 ICU patients each. These<lb/> datasets were obtained as a part of PhysionNet/CinC<lb/> Challenge 2012 (prediction of the mortality in ICU). Two<lb/> different metrics, namely, (Event1) the minimum of<lb/> sensitivity and positive predictive value and (Event2) a<lb/> goodness of fit measure (range-normalized Hosmer-<lb/>Lemeshow (H) statistic) was used to assess the<lb/> algorithm&apos;s performance. The proposed algorithm<lb/> achieved an Event 1 score of 0.50, 0.50 and an Event 2<lb/> score of 15.18, 78.9 compared to SAPS-I (Event 1:<lb/> 0.3170, 0.312 and Event 2: 66.03, 68.58) in the two<lb/> different validation dataset respectively. Furthermore,<lb/> since the proposed algorithm uses instantaneous values of<lb/> vitals and labs, it could be used as a continuous, real-<lb/>time patient specific indicator of mortality risk.<lb/></div>
