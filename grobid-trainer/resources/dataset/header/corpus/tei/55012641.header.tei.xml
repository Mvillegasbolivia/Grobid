	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> To identify senescence-associated genes (SAGs) in<lb/> rice leaves, senescence was induced by trans-<lb/>ferring rice seedlings into darkness. Senescence<lb/> up-regulated cDNAs were obtained by PCR-based<lb/> subtractive hybridization. Among 14 SAG clones<lb/> characterized, 11 were found to be associated with<lb/> both dark-induced and natural leaf senescence.<lb/> Three clones were associated only with dark-induced<lb/> leaf senescence. The possible physiological roles<lb/> of these SAGs during rice leaf senescence are<lb/> discussed.<lb/></div>

	<keyword>Key words: Dark-induced senescence, gene expression,<lb/> natural leaf senescence, rice.<lb/></keyword>
