	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Ambisonics, a sound field synthesis and reproduction technique, has shown promising results in conveying<lb/> three-dimensional spatialized sound. Ambisonic encodings directly describe the spatial properties of sound fields without<lb/> reference to the reproduction system. Precise regeneration of a sound field requires a large number of loudspeakers<lb/> arranged so as to adequately sample all directions; this is referred to as a regular layout. It is not difficult to find a<lb/> decoding matrix to reproduce Ambisonic recordings using uniformly distributed loudspeakers. Nevertheless, evenly<lb/> locating a large number of loudspeakers is not feasible in most scenarios. Irregular arrays, however, are known to lead<lb/> to ill-conditioned and singular re-encoding matrices. We propose a method for accurate reproduction of high order<lb/> Ambisonic recordings over irregular loudspeaker arrays. Our approach consists of three stages which aim to exploit any<lb/> regularities of the array, while using asymmetrically located loudspeakers to expand the listening volume. We evaluated<lb/> our proposal using an irregular 157-channel loudspeaker array. Comparisons with mainstream decoding methods were<lb/> conducted. The proposed scheme results in an overall increase in the size of the listening volume.<lb/></div>
