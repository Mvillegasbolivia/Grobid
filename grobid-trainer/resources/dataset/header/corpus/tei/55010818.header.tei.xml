	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Hyperspectral data processing typically demands enormous computational resources in terms of storage, com-<lb/>putation and I/O throughputs, especially when real-time processing is desired. In this paper, we investigate a low-<lb/>complexity scheme for hyperspectral data compression and reconstruction. In this scheme, compressed hyperspectral<lb/> data are acquired directly by a device similar to the single-pixel camera [5] based on the principle of compressive<lb/> sensing. To decode the compressed data, we propose a numerical procedure to directly compute the unmixed abundance<lb/> fractions of given endmembers, completely bypassing high-complexity tasks involving the hyperspectral data cube<lb/> itself. The reconstruction model is to minimize the total variation of the abundance fractions subject to a pre-<lb/>processed fidelity equation with a significantly reduced size, and other side constraints. An augmented Lagrangian type<lb/> algorithm is developed to solve this model. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the feasibility<lb/> and efficiency of the proposed approach, using both synthetic data and hardware-measured data. Experimental and<lb/> computational evidences obtained from this study indicate that the proposed scheme has a high potential in real-world<lb/> applications.<lb/></div>
