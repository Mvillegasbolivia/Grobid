	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> In a class of games known as Stackelberg games, one agent (the<lb/> leader) must commit to a strategy that can be observed by the other<lb/> agent (the follower or adversary) before the adversary chooses its<lb/> own strategy. We consider Bayesian Stackelberg games, in which<lb/> the leader is uncertain about the types of adversary it may face.<lb/> Such games are important in security domains, where, for exam-<lb/>ple, a security agent (leader) must commit to a strategy of patrolling<lb/> certain areas, and a robber (follower) has a chance to observe this<lb/> strategy over time before choosing its own strategy of where to at-<lb/>tack. This paper presents an efficient exact algorithm for finding the<lb/> optimal strategy for the leader to commit to in these games. This<lb/> algorithm, DOBSS, is based on a novel and compact mixed-integer<lb/> linear programming formulation. Compared to the most efficient<lb/> algorithm known previously for this problem, DOBSS is not only<lb/> faster, but also leads to higher quality solutions, and does not suf-<lb/>fer from problems of infeasibility that were faced by this previous<lb/> algorithm. Note that DOBSS is at the heart of the ARMOR system<lb/> that is currently being tested for security scheduling at the Los An-<lb/>geles International Airport.<lb/></div>
