	<div type="abstract">In this work, homogeneous as well as gradient a-C:H:W coatings were deposited on a steel substrate. The me-<lb/>chanical properties of both coating systems were determined using nanoindentation. In addition, a multiaxial,<lb/> 3-dimensional nanoindentation test (reciprocating wear test with nanometre resolution) was carried out in<lb/> order to analyse the wear-performance of the two different coating systems.<lb/> By comparing the wear-performance of the gradient coating system to the non-graduated one we were able to<lb/> show that according to a theoretical approach proposed a few years ago the gradient coating systems lead to a<lb/> better performance in micro-wear tests as well as in macro-scale wear tests.<lb/> In addition, a new wear model taking into account the changing stress fields during the wear tests is proposed in<lb/> order to simulate the wear behaviour of both coating systems.<lb/>
