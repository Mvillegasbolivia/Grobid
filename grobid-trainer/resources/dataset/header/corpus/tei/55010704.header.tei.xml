	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> We explore 5 network communication problems where the possibility of interference align-<lb/>ment, and consequently the total number of degrees of freedom (DoF) with channel uncertainty<lb/> at the transmitters are unknown. These problems share the common property that in each case<lb/> the best known outer bounds are essentially robust to channel uncertainty and represent the<lb/> outcome with interference alignment, but the best inner bounds – in some cases conjectured<lb/> to be optimal – predict a total collapse of DoF, thus indicating the infeasibility of interference<lb/> alignment under channel uncertainty at transmitters. Our main contribution is to show that<lb/> even with no knowledge of channel coefficient values at the transmitters, the knowledge of the<lb/> channels&apos; correlation structure can be exploited to achieve interference alignment. In each case,<lb/> we show that under a staggered block fading model, the transmitters are able to align interfer-<lb/>ence without the knowledge of channel coefficient values. The alignment schemes are based on<lb/> linear beamforming – which can be seen as a repetition code over a small number of symbols –<lb/> and involve delays of only a few coherence intervals.</div>
