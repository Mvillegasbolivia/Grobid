	<div type="abstract">To examine the possibility that cytokines produced in inflamed<lb/> joint tissues may contribute to the loss of articular cartilage by<lb/> causing inhibition of synthesis of cartilage-specific matrix macro-<lb/>molecules, we studied the effects of interferon y (IFNy) and<lb/> tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa), alone and in combination, on<lb/> the expression of the genes for types-II, -IX and -XI collagens in<lb/> cultured human chondrocytes. Chondrocytes isolated from<lb/> human fetal epiphyseal cartilage by sequential enzymic digestions<lb/> were cultured in the presence of IFNy (30 pM), TNFac (15 pM)<lb/> or a combination of suboptimal concentrations of both cytokines<lb/> (1.5 pM IFNy plus 0.3 pM TNFa). IFNy caused a maximal<lb/> decrease of 23.3-32.6 % in the biosynthesis of collagen by<lb/> chondrocytes. TNFa was a more potent inhibitor causing a<lb/> 42.8-45.3 % decrease at one-half the concentration of IFNy. A<lb/> synergistic inhibitory effect of 58.2% was observed with the<lb/></div>
