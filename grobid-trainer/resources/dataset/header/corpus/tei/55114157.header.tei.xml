	<div type="abstract">Abstract--This document is only a literature summary, intended<lb/> for the purpose of understanding the available Inter-RAT<lb/> (Radio Access Technology) Handover techniques. The<lb/> References section at the end of this report encompasses the<lb/> sources of information. This study is done as part of the course –<lb/> Advanced Telecommunications, provided at the department of<lb/> Information Technology, LTH.<lb/></div>

	<div type="introduction">A.<lb/> INTRODUCTION<lb/> Investigation of Handovers (HO) between different<lb/> radio access technologies opens up a wide range of<lb/> optimization possibilities in terms of utilization of<lb/> network resources and better coverage capabilities. The<lb/> chief challenge lies in making this process seamless, in<lb/> the sense that the end to end connection remains intact<lb/> throughout the process and the engine that runs the<lb/> machinery of making this switch shields the upper<lb/> layers from noticing any change in the basic bearer<lb/> Quality of Service (QoS) expected for the ongoing<lb/> service. The study here mainly concentrates on the<lb/> challenges involved in handovers between the 3 most<lb/> ubiquitous technologies encountered in everyday<lb/> scenario-2G (GSM/GPRS, almost legendary system),<lb/> 3G (WCDMA/UMTS, fastest growing mobile system),<lb/> WLAN (IEEE802.11, along with HIPERLAN, the best<lb/> pedestrian-based, high speed packet access system).<lb/> The study here is expected to equip one with the basic<lb/> understanding of the primary problems, implementation<lb/> issues and design challenges involved in transitioning<lb/> of a system that supports intra-system HO to one that<lb/> supports inter-system HO, involving heterogeneous<lb/> networks.</div>
