	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> In automatic lipreading, the speaker&apos;s head movement<lb/> can affect the mouth shape appearing in the captured im-<lb/>ages independently of the true mouth shape. Such distor-<lb/>tion can lead to incorrect recognition of visual speech,<lb/> thus this problem must be dealt with for a practical ap-<lb/>plication. We have developed a system that accomodates<lb/> the 3D head movement of the speaker in recognising the<lb/> mouth shape of unadorned lips appearing in the image.<lb/> This is achieved by tracking the 3D head movement from<lb/> the 2D input and correcting the mouth shape that is de-<lb/>tected from the image, in order to robustly recognise the<lb/> visual phonemes. The system allows the speaker&apos;s head<lb/> to move and exhibit rotations of up to 30 degrees away<lb/> from the camera. An experiment is presented, showing<lb/> head movements in 3D while the speaker enunciates 5<lb/> phonemes that represent the various mouth shapes of vi-<lb/>sual speech. The result shows that the 3D head tracker<lb/> robustly tracks the 3D head movement, and accomodat-<lb/>ing head pose to correct mouth shape is achieved effec-<lb/>tively.<lb/></div>
