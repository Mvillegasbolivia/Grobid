	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) flooding is a conventional process in which the CO 2 is injected into the oil reservoir to increase the<lb/> quantity of extracting oil. This process also controls the amount of released CO 2 as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere which<lb/> is known as CO 2 sequestration process. However, the mobility of the CO 2 inside the hydrocarbon reservoir is higher than the<lb/> crude oil and always viscous fingering and gravity override problems occur during a CO 2 injection. The most common<lb/> method to overcome these problems is to trap the gas bubbles in the liquid phase in form of aqueous foam prior to CO 2<lb/> injection. Although, the aqueous foams are not thermodynamically stable, the special care should be considered to ensure<lb/> about bulk foam preparation and stability. Selection of a proper foaming agent from a large number of available surfactants is<lb/> the main step in the bulk foam preparation. To meet this purpose, many chemical and crude oil based surfactants have been<lb/> reported but most of them are not sustainable and have disposal problems. The objective of this experimental study is to<lb/> employ Lingosulfonate and Alkyl Polyglucosides (APGs) as two sustainable foaming agents for the bulk foam stability<lb/> investigations and foam flooding performance in porous media. In the initial part, the bulk foam stability results showed that<lb/> APGs provided more stable foams in compare with Lingosulfonate in all surfactant concentrations. In the second part, the<lb/> results indicated that the bulk foam stability measurements provide a good indication of foam mobility in porous media. The<lb/> foaming agent&apos;s concentration which provided the maximum foam stability also gave the highest value of mobility reduction<lb/> in porous media.<lb/></div>
