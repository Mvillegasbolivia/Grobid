	<div type="abstract">Abstract Phenotypic expression of chondrocytes can be modulated in vitro by changing the culture technique<lb/> and by agents such vitamins and growth factors. We studied the effects of ascorbic acid, retinoic acid (0.5 and 10 µM),<lb/> and dihydrocytochalasin B (3, 10, 20 µM DHCB), separately or in combination (ascorbic acid ϩ retinoic acid or ascorbic<lb/> acid ϩ DHCB), on the induction of maturation of fetal bovine epiphyseal chondrocytes grown for up to 4 weeks at high<lb/> density in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and the various agents. In the absence of any agent or with retinoic<lb/> acid or DHCB alone, the metabolic activity of the cells remained very low after day 6, with no induction of type I or X<lb/> collagen synthesis nor increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. Chondrocytes treated with fresh ascorbic acid showed<lb/> active protein synthesis associated with expression of types I and X after 6 and 13 days, respectively. This maturation was<lb/> not accompanied by obvious hypertrophy of the cells or high alkaline phosphatase activity. Addition of retinoic acid to<lb/> the ascorbic acid-treated cultures decreased the level of type II collagen synthesis and delayed the induction of types I<lb/> and X collagen, which were present only after 30 days. A striking increase in alkaline phosphatase activity (15–20-fold)<lb/> was observed in the presence of both ascorbic acid and the highest dose of retinoic acid (10 µM). DHCB was also a<lb/> potent inhibitor of the maturation induced by treatment with ascorbic acid, as the chondrocytes maintained their<lb/> rounded shape and synthesized type II collagen without induction of type I or X collagen. The pattern of protein<lb/> secretion was compared under all culture conditions by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The different regulations<lb/> of chondrocyte differentiation by ascorbic acid, retinoic acid, and DHCB were confirmed by the important qualitative<lb/> and quantitative changes in the pattern of secreted proteins observed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis along the<lb/> study.
