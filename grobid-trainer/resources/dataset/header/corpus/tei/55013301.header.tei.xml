	<div type="abstract">Abstract: An easy source of unusual monosaccharides such as the 6-deoxyhexose, L-fucose are certain<lb/> microbial extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), best known for their thickening, gelling or emulsifying<lb/> properties. L-Fucose and L-fucose containing oligosaccharides have potential application in the<lb/> medical ®eld in preventing tumour cell colonisation of the lung (anticancer effect), in controlling the<lb/> formation of white blood cells (anti-in¯ammatory effect), in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, in<lb/> the synthesis of antigens for antibody production (rational immunisation) and in cosmeceuticals as<lb/> skin moisturing agent. L-Fucose production via chemical synthesis is laborious and suffers from low<lb/> yield, while direct extraction from brown algae is costly and subject to seasonal variations in supply<lb/> volume and quality. Enzymatic synthesis is currently under investigation. Chemical or enzymatic<lb/> hydrolysis of L-fucose-rich microbial EPS opens up a new route towards ef®cient L-fucose production.<lb/> This review deals with the properties, occurrence, physiological roles, chemical, enzymatic and<lb/> microbial production of L-fucose.<lb/> #</div>
