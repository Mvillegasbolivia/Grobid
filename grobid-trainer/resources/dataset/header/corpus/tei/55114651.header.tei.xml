	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> This document provides the description for a Test Model under Consideration (TMuC). This suggested<lb/> Test Model is intended to provide a coding efficiency close to the best performing proposals in the<lb/> subjective test of the CfP submissions and also to provide a complexity point that is close to that of the<lb/> lowest complexity submissions shown to provide substantial improvement of coding efficiency. The<lb/> inclusion of a technology in this document does not indicate a final adoption of the technology as an<lb/> element of an approved test model of the committee. Rather, it indicates a preliminary selection which<lb/> may require further evaluation and justification to achieve that status.<lb/> This TMuC is based on the decisions taken at the 1<lb/> st meeting of JCT-VC in Dresden from 15-23 April<lb/> 2010 and the further refinements agreed at the 2<lb/> nd meeting of JCT-VC in Geneva from 21-28 July 2010.<lb/> The principal documents agreed at the 2<lb/> nd meeting of JCT-VC which affect this TMuC are:<lb/>  Unified intra prediction (JCTVC-B100)<lb/>  Rounding control and transform precision expansion (JCTVC-B074)</div>
