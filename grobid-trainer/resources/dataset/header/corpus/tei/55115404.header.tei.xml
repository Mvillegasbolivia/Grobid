	<docAuthor>Producers:<lb/> Mike Chiaram onte and Matt Slay baugh<lb/> </docAuthor>

	<div type="introduction">Description:<lb/> Fun and educational for both children and<lb/> adults, the m-Box im plicitly teaches the basics<lb/> of tonality and the m usical scale by allowing<lb/> the user to explore the art of m usic com position<lb/> without hav ing to know how to play an<lb/> instrum ent or ev en know any thing about<lb/> m usic.<lb/> Intended Audience:<lb/> Although the m-Box was originally intended<lb/> prim arily for children ages 6 to 1 2 , a m ore<lb/> elaborately fabricated m odel would also appeal<lb/> to adults in the form of an executiv e office toy .<lb/> Background:<lb/> The im petus behind the m-Box was sim ply to<lb/> build a toy . After study ing m any toy s on the<lb/> m arket today and researching how children<lb/> play , we decided to narrow our focus on an<lb/> educational toy that was not ov ertly &apos;about&apos;<lb/> teaching. We both are interested in m usic and<lb/> com position and independently cam e up with<lb/> the idea to hav e a program m able m usic box,<lb/> one that would hav e no rules outside the<lb/> phy sical param eters of the dev ice itself, and<lb/> m-Box -Electronic Music Box<lb/></div>
