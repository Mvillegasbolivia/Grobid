	<div type="abstract">We have previously reported (1) the molecular cloning of a DNA<lb/> fragment from Bacillus circulans WL-12 which directs the<lb/> synthesis in E. coli of an enzyme that specifically degrades<lb/> lichenan (mixed-linkage 1,3-1,4-,B-glucan). The nucleotide<lb/> sequence of the 1987-bp BamHI-HindLlI fragment containing the<lb/> 1,3-1,4-,-glucanase gene (BGC), has been determined. The BGC<lb/> gene comprises an open reading frame of 1227-bp coding for<lb/> a 409-amino acid precursor polypeptide with a calculated<lb/> molecular weight of 44812 daltons, in close agreement with the<lb/> value of 40500 previously estimated for the mature extracellular<lb/> form by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Kyte and<lb/> Doolittle hydropathy plot of the deduced amino acid sequence<lb/> shows a protein in which the N-terminus is the most hydrophobic<lb/> region, with structural features resembling those found in signal<lb/> peptides of secreted proteins. A search for putative promoters<lb/> upstream from the proposed translation initiation codon identified<lb/> two hexamers related to the -35 and -10 consensus sequences,<lb/> located at the appropriate distance (17 bp): TTGACG (positions<lb/> -190 to -185) and GATGAT (positions -167 to -162). A<lb/> presumed ribosome-binding sequence AAAGGAGCGU, which<lb/> is complementary to the 3&apos; end of B. subtilis 16S rRNA, is found<lb/> immediately preceeding (6 bp) the initiation codon. Beyond the<lb/> translation stop codon, a sequence of 33 nucleotides (positions<lb/> + 1328 to + 1360) can be folded into a stem-loop structure which<lb/> might function as a transcriptional terminator. No significant<lb/> amino acid sequence homology was found between the BGC<lb/> product and other 1,3-1,4-,B-glucanases from different Bacillus<lb/> species, such as B. subtilis (2) and B. amyloliquefaciens (3), or<lb/> with a 1,3-,B-glucanase from the same microorganism B. circulans<lb/> WL-12 recently reported (4).<lb/></div>
