	<div type="abstract">The aim of this work was to investigate the behavior of thermophilic esterase EST2 from Alicyclobacillus<lb/> acidocaldarius in milk and cheese models. The pure enzyme was used to compare the EST2 hydrolytic activity<lb/> to the activity of endogenous esterase EstA from Lactococcus lactis. The results indicate that EST2 exhibits<lb/> 30-fold-higher esterase activity than EstA. As EstA has thioesterase activity, EST2 was assayed for this activity<lb/> under the optimal conditions determined for EstA (namely, 30°C and pH 7.5). Although it is a thermophilic<lb/> enzyme, EST2 exhibited eightfold-higher thioesterase activity than EstA with S-methyl thiobutanoate. The<lb/> abilities of EST2 and EstA to synthesize short-chain fatty acid esters were compared. Two methods were<lb/> developed to do this. In the first method a spectrophotometric assay was used to monitor the synthesis of esters<lb/> by the pure enzymes using p-nitrophenol as the alcohol substrate. The synthetic activities were also evaluated<lb/> under conditions that mimicked those present in milk and/or cheese. The second method involved evaluation<lb/> of the synthetic abilities of the enzymes when they were directly added to a model cheese matrix. Substantial<lb/> ester synthesis by EST2 was observed under both conditions. Finally, esterase and thioesterase activities were<lb/> evaluated in milk using the purified EST2 enzyme and in the model cheese matrix using a strain of L. lactis<lb/> NZ9000 harboring the EST2 gene and thus overproducing EST2. Both the esterase and thioesterase activities<lb/> measured in milk and in the cheese matrix were much greater than the activities of the controls.<lb/></div>
