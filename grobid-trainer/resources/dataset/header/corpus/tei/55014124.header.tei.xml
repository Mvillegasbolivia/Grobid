	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The sulfonated tetrazolium 2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2-tetrazolium 5-carboxanilide (XTT) is advantageous in<lb/> that it yields a water-soluble formazan, unlike most other available tetrazoliums. XTT is reducible by superoxide, as are other<lb/> tetrazoliums, but is not directly reduced by xanthine oxidase plus xanthine or by glucose oxidase plus glucose. This led to the<lb/> suggestion that XTT reduction might serve as a reliable index of intracellular O<lb/> Ã€</div>
