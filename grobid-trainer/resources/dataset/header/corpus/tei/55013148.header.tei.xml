	<div type="abstract">A glycerol-nonutilizing mutant of the salt-tolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii was isolated. When subjected<lb/> to salt stress the mutant produced glycerol, and the internal level of glycerol increased linearly in proportion<lb/> to increases of external salinity as in the wild-type strain. However, at increased salinity the mutant showed a<lb/> more pronounced decrease of growth rate and growth yield and lost more glycerol to the surrounding medium<lb/> than did the wild type. Uptake experiments showed glycerol to be accumulated against a strong concentration<lb/> gradient, and both strains displayed similar kinetic parameters for the uptake of glycerol. An examination of<lb/> enzyme activities of the glycerol metabolism revealed that the apparent Km of the sn-glycerol 3-phosphate<lb/> dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5) was increased 330-fold for sn-glycerol 3-phosphate in the mutant. Based on the<lb/> findings, a scheme for the pathways of glycerol metabolism is suggested.<lb/></div>
