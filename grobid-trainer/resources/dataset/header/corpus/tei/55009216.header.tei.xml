	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The relevance of aviation security has increased dramatically in recent years.<lb/> Airport security technology has evolved remarkably over the last decade, which<lb/> is especially evident for state-of-the-art X-ray screening systems. However, such<lb/> systems will be only as effective as the people who operate them. Recognizing<lb/> all kinds of prohibited items in X-ray images of passenger bags is a challenging<lb/> object recognition task. In this article we present a method to measure screener<lb/> detection performance based on signal detection theory. This method is applied<lb/> to measure training effects resulting from individually adaptive computer based<lb/> training (CBT). We have found large increases of detection performance and<lb/> substantial reductions in response time suggesting that CBT is a very effective<lb/> tool for increasing effectiveness and efficiency in aviation security screening.<lb/></div>
